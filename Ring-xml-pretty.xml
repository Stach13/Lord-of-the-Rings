    <p>FOREWORD</p>

    <p>This tale grew in the telling, until it became a history of the Great War of the Ring and
        included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history that preceded it. It was begun soon
        after _The Hobbit_ was written and before its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with
        this sequel, for I wished first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of
        the Elder Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do this for my
        own satisfaction, and I had little hope that other people would be interested in this work,
        especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to
        provide the necessary background of<quote> 'history' </quote>for Elvish tongues.</p>
    <p> When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected _little hope_ to _no hope,_ I went
        back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from readers for more information concerning
        hobbits and their adventures. But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world,
        and became an account, as it were, of its end and passing away before its beginning and
        middle had been told. The process had begun in the writing of _The Hobbit,_ in which there
        were already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and the
        orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than
        its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery of the
        significance of these glimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the
        Third Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring.</p>
    <p> Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it, but they had to
        wait a long time; for the composition of _The Lord of the Rings_ went on at intervals during
        the years 1936 to 1949, a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect, and many
        other interests as a learner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was, of course,
        also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which year the tale had not yet
        reached the end of Book One. In spite of the darkness of the next five years I found that
        the story could not now be wholly abandoned, and I plodded on, mostly by night, till I stood
        by Balin's tomb in Moria. There I halted for a long while. It was almost a year later when I
        went on and so came to Lothl�rien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year I wrote
        the first drafts of the matter that now stands as Book Three, and the beginnings of chapters
        I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons flared in An�rien and Th�oden came to
        Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had failed and there was no time for thought.</p>
    <p> It was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war which it was my
        task to conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself to tackle the journey of Frodo to
        Mordor. These chapters, eventually to become Book Four, were written and sent out as a
        serial to my son, Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took
        another five years before the tale was brought to its present end; in that time I changed my
        house, my chair, and my college, and the days though less dark were no less laborious. Then
        when the<quote> 'end' </quote>had at last been reached the whole story had to be revised,
        and indeed largely re-written backwards. And it had to be typed, and re-typed: by me; the
        cost of professional typing by the ten-fingered was beyond my means.</p>
    <p> _The Lord of the Rings_ has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print; and
        I should like to say something here with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I
        have received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive
        was the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the
        attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply
        move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving, and for
        many the guide was inevitably often at fault. Some who have read the book, or at any rate
        have reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to
        complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they
        evidently prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story there
        is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody
        at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters
        that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by
        others specially approved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects,
        minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review the book or to
        write it again, he will pass over these in silence, except one that has been noted by
        others: the book is too short.</p>
    <p> As for any inner meaning or<quote> 'message',</quote> it has in the intention of the author
        none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put down roots (into the
        past) and threw out unexpected branches: but its main theme was settled from the outset by
        the inevitable choice of the Ring as the link between it and _The Hobbit._ The crucial
        chapter, "The Shadow of the Past', is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It was written
        long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and from
        that point the story would have developed along essentially the same lines, if that disaster
        had been averted. Its sources are things long before in mind, or in some cases already
        written, and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in 1939 or its
        sequels.</p>
    <p> The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion. If it had
        inspired or directed the development of the legend, then certainly the Ring would have been
        seized and used against Sauron; he would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and
        Barad-d�r would not have been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of
        the Ring, would m the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing
        links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring
        of his own with which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict
        both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived
        even as slaves.</p>
    <p> Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like
        allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations,
        and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much
        prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience
        of readers. I think that many confuse<quote> 'applicability' </quote>with<quote>
            'allegory';</quote> but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in
        the purposed domination of the author.</p>
    <p> An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience, but the ways in which
        a story-germ uses the soil of experience are extremely complex, and attempts to define the
        process are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous. It is also
        false, though naturally attractive, when the lives of an author and critic have overlapped,
        to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times common to both were
        necessarily the most powerful influences. One has indeed personally to come under the shadow
        of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten
        that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in
        1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead. Or to take
        a less grievous matter: it has been supposed by some that<quote> 'The Scouring of the Shire'
        </quote>reflects the situation in England at the time when I was finishing my tale. It does
        not. It is an essential part of the plot, foreseen from the outset, though in the event
        modified by the character of Saruman as developed in the story without, need I say, any
        allegorical significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed some
        basis in experience, though slender (for the economic situation was entirely different), and
        much further back. The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed
        before I was ten, in days when motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men
        were still building suburban railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last
        decrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so
        important. I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had
        a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.</p>
    <p> _The Lord of the Rings_ is now issued in a new edition, and the opportunity has been taken
        of revising it. A number of errors and inconsistencies that still remained in the text have
        been corrected, and an attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which
        attentive readers have raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries, and if
        some seem to have been passed over that may be because I have failed to keep my notes in
        order; but many enquiries could only be answered by additional appendices, or indeed by the
        production of an accessory volume containing much of the material that I did not include in
        the original edition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In the meantime
        this edition offers this Foreword, an addition to the Prologue, some notes, and an index of
        the names of persons and places. This index is in intention complete in items but not in
        references, since for the present purpose it has been necessary to reduce its bulk. A
        complete index, making full use of the material prepared for me by Mrs. N. Smith, belongs
        rather to the accessory volume.</p>



    <p> PROLOGUE</p>

    <p>This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a reader may discover much of
        their character and a little of their history. Further information will also be found in the
        selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has already been published, under the title of
        _The Hobbit_. That story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed by
        Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and called by him
        _There and Back Again,_ since they told of his journey into the East and his return: an
        adventure which later involved all the Hobbits in the great events of that Age that are here
        related.</p>
    <p> Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset, while
        some may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more important
        points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and the first adventure is briefly recalled.</p>


    <p> Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are
        today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed
        countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not and did not understand or like machines
        more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were
        skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of<quote> 'the Big
            Folk',</quote> as they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard
        to find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined to be fat
        and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements.
        They possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk
        whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to
        Men it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic of any kind, and
        their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a
        close friendship with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.</p>
    <p> For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout and stocky, that is, even when
        they are not actually much shorter. Their height is variable, ranging between two and four
        feet of our measure. They seldom now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they say, and
        in ancient days they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer),
        son of Isengrim the Second, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He was surpassed in
        all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old; but that curious matter is dealt
        with in this book.</p>
    <p> As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, in the days of their
        peace and prosperity they were a merry folk. They dressed in bright colours, being notably
        fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery
        soles and were clad in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was
        commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was shoe-making; but they
        had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and comely things. Their faces
        were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with
        mouths apt to laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and drink,
        often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals a day (when
        they could get them). They were hospitable and delighted in parties, and in presents, which
        they gave away freely and eagerly accepted.</p>
    <p> It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours: far
        nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after
        their own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly
        our relationship is can no longer be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in
        the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves still preserve any records of
        that vanished time, and their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own
        history, in which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear
        that Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other
        folk became even aware of them. And the world being after all full of strange creatures
        beyond count, these little people seemed of very little importance. But in the days of
        Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, by no wish of their own, both important
        and renowned, and troubled the counsels of the Wise and the Great.</p>

    <p> Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and the shape of all lands has
        been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those
        in which they still linger: the North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea. Of their
        original home the Hobbits in Bilbo's time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other
        than genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there remained still a few in
        the older families who studied their own books, and even gathered reports of old times and
        distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Their own records began only after the
        settlement of the Shire, and their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than
        their Wandering Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of
        their peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in the distant past
        moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper
        vales of Anduin, between the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains. Why they
        later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer
        certain. Their own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow
        that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was Mirkwood.</p>
    <p> Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become divided into three
        somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of
        skin, smaller, and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were
        neat and nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader,
        heavier in build; their feet and hands were larger, and they preferred flat lands and
        riversides. The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and
        slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.</p>
    <p> The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and long lived in the foothills
        of the mountains. They moved westward early, and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop
        while the others were still in the Wilderland. They were the most normal and representative
        variety of Hobbit, and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one
        place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.</p>
    <p> The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin, and were less shy of Men.
        They came west after the Harfoots and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and
        there many of them long dwelt between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved
        north again.</p>
    <p> The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were more friendly with
        Elves than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in language and song than in
        handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains north
        of Rivendell and came down the River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with the other
        kinds that had preceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were
        often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even in Bilbo's time
        the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the greater families, such as the
        Tooks and the Masters of Buckland.</p>
    <p> In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains and the Mountains of Lune, the
        Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the D�nedain, the
        kings of Men that came over the Sea out of Westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the
        lands of their North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to
        spare for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered communities. Most of
        their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in Bilbo's time; but one
        of the first to become important still endured, though reduced in size; this was at Bree and
        in the Chetwood that lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire.</p>
    <p> It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their letters and began to
        write after the manner of the D�nedain, who had in their turn long before learned the art
        from the Elves. And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before,
        and spoke ever after the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current
        through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea
        from Belfalas to Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their own, as well as their own names of
        months and days, and a great store of personal names out of the past.</p>
    <p> About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning of years.
        For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the Third Age that the
        Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set out from Bree; and having obtained permission
        from the high king at Fornost, they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following
        of Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been built in the days of the
        power of the North Kingdom, and they took ail the land beyond to dwell in, between the river
        and the Far Downs. All that was demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge
        in repair, and all other bridges and roads, speed the king's messengers, and acknowledge his
        lordship.</p>
    <p> Thus began the _Shire-reckoning,_ for the year of the crossing of the Brandywine (as the
        Hobbits turned the name) became Year One of the Shire, and all later dates were reckoned
        from it. At once the western Hobbits fell in love with their new land, and they remained
        there, and soon passed once more out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was
        still a king they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by their own
        chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the last battle at
        Fornost with the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid of the king, or so
        they maintained, though no tales of Men record it. But in that war the North Kingdom ended;
        and then the Hobbits took the land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a
        Thain to hold the authority of the king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were
        little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark Plague (S.R. 37)
        until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that followed it. Many thousands then
        perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60) were at the time of this tale long past and the
        Hobbits had again become accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it
        had long been deserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, and there the
        king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.</p>
    <p> Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, and fifty from the
        northern moors to the marshes in the south. The Hobbits named it the Shire, as the region of
        the authority of their Thain, and a district of well-ordered business; and there in that
        pleasant comer of the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they
        heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think
        that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk. They
        forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians, and of the labours of
        those that made possible the long peace of the Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but
        they had ceased to remember it.</p>
    <p> At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never fought among themselves.
        In olden days they had, of course, been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a
        hard world; but in Bilbo's time that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this
        story opens, and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the
        Shire, was beyond living memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Bandobras
        Took routed an invasion of Orcs. Even the weathers had grown milder, and the wolves that had
        once come ravening out of the North in bitter white winters were now only a grandfather's
        tale. So, though there was still some store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly
        as trophies, hanging above hearths or on walls, or gathered into the museum at Michel
        Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits had no immediate use for,
        but were unwilling to throw away, they called a _mathom_. Their dwellings were apt to become
        rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of
        that son.</p>
    <p> Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if it
        came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of
        good things not least because they could, when put to it, do without them, and could survive
        rough handling by grief, foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know
        them well and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though slow to
        quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty at bay, and at need
        could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for they were keen-eyed and sure at
        the mark. Not only with bows and arrows. If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to
        get quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.</p>
    <p> All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they believed, and in such
        dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the course of time they had been obliged to
        adopt other forms of abode. Actually in the Shire in Bilbo's days it was, as a rule, only
        the richest and the poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on
        living in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window or
        none; while the well-to-do still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings
        of old. But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels (or _smials_ as they called
        them) were not everywhere to be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the
        Hobbits, as they multiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions
        and the older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or in the chief township of the
        Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, there were now many houses of wood, brick, or
        stone. These were specially favoured by millers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights, and others
        of that sort; for even when they had holes to live in. Hobbits had long been accustomed to
        build sheds and workshops.</p>
    <p> The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants of
        the Marish down by the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that quarter, the Eastfarthing, were
        rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were
        well known to be Stoors in a large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that
        many grew on their chins. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the folk
        of the Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River, which they afterwards occupied, came for
        the most part later into the Shire up from south-away; and they still had many peculiar
        names and strange words not found elsewhere in the Shire.</p>
    <p> It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, was derived from the
        D�nedain. But the Hobbits may have learned it direct from the Elves, the teachers of Men in
        their youth. For the Elves of the High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they
        dwelt still at that time at the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within
        reach of the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the Tower
        Hills beyond the western marches. They shone far off in the moonlight. The tallest was
        furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that
        one could see the Sea from the lop of that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb
        it. Indeed, few Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever
        returned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats with deep
        misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the days of the Shire lengthened they
        spoke less and less with the Elves, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful of those that
        had dealings with them; and the Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death,
        and they turned their faces away from the hills in the west.</p>
    <p> The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits used it in their own
        fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and
        comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no more than built imitations of _smials,_
        thatched with dry grass or straw, or roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged.
        That stage, however, belonged to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit-building had long
        since been altered, improved by devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by themselves.
        A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was the chief remaining peculiarity of
        hobbit-architecture.</p>
    <p> The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large, and inhabited by large families.
        (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many other
        ways, such as their friendship with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of
        Great Smials, or the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives lived in
        (comparative) peace together in one ancestral and many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were,
        in any case, clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care. They drew long
        and elaborate family-trees with innumerable branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is
        important to remember who is related to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in
        this book to set out a family-tree that included even the more important members of the more
        important families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical trees at the end
        of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in themselves, and all but Hobbits would find
        them exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked
        to have books filled with things that they already knew, set out fair and square with no
        contradictions.</p>





    <p> There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that must be mentioned, an
        astonishing habit: they imbibed or inhaled, through pipes of clay or wood, the smoke of the
        burning leaves of a herb, which they called _pipe-weed_ or _leaf,_ a variety probably of
        _Nicotiana._ A great deal of mystery surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or<quote>
            'art' </quote>as the Hobbits preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it
        in antiquity was put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since
        he and the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that follows, his remarks
        in the introduction to his _Herblore of the Shire_ may be quoted.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'This,' </quote>he says, 'is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own
        invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke is not known, all the legends and family
        histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire smoked various herbs, some fouler,
        some sweeter. But all accounts agree that Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom in the
        Southfarthing first grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the
        Second, about the year 1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that
        district, especially the varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and Southern
        Star.</p>
    <p> 'How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day he would not tell. He
        knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went often
        to Bree, though he certainly never went further from the Shire than that. It is thus quite
        possible that he learned of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on the
        south slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first actual smokers of
        the pipe-weed. They claim, of course, to have done everything before the people of the
        Shire, whom they refer to as "colonists"; but in this case their claim is, I think, likely
        to be true. And certainly it was from Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread
        in the recent centuries among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers,
        as still passed to and fro through that ancient road-meeting. The home and centre of the an
        is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, _The Prancing Pony,_ that has been kept by the
        family of Butterbur from time beyond record.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'All the same, observations that I have made on my own many journeys south have
            convinced me that the weed itself is not native to our parts of the world, but came
            northward from the lower Anduin, whither it was, I suspect, originally brought over Sea
            by the Men of Westernesse. It grows abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger
            than in the North, where it is never found wild, and flourishes only in warm sheltered
            places like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it _sweet galenas,_ and esteem it only
            for the fragrance of its flowers. From that land it must have been carried up the
            Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and our own day. But
            even the D�nedain of Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits first put it into pipes. Not
            even the Wizards first thought of that before we did. Though one Wizard that I knew took
            up the art long ago, and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his
            mind to.'</quote>
    </p>

    <p> The Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings already referred to. North, South,
        East, and West; and these again each into a number of folklands, which still bore the names
        of some of the old leading families, although by the time of this history these names were
        no longer found only in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in the
        Tookland, but that was not true of many other families, such as the Bagginses or the
        Boffins. Outside the Farthings were the East and West Marches: the Buckland (see beginning
        of Chapter V, Book I); and the Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1462.</p>
    <p> The Shire at this time had hardly any<quote> 'government'.</quote> Families for the most
        part managed their own affairs. Growing food and eating it occupied most of their time. In
        other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not greedy, but contented and moderate, so
        that estates, farms, workshops, and small trades tended to remain unchanged for
        generations.</p>
    <p> There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high king at Fornost, or
        Norbury as they called it, away north of the Shire. But there had been no king for nearly a
        thousand years, and even the ruins of Kings' Norbury were covered with grass. Yet the
        Hobbits still said of wild folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard
        of the king. For they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually
        they kept the laws of free will, because they were The Rules (as they said), both ancient
        and just.</p>
    <p> It is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent; for the office of Thain had
        passed to them (from the Oldbucks) some centuries before, and the chief Took had borne that
        title ever since. The Thain was the master of the Shire-moot, and captain of the
        Shire-muster and the Hobbitry-in-arms, but as muster and moot were only held in times of
        emergency, which no longer occurred, the Thainship had ceased to be more than a nominal
        dignity. The Took family was still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for it remained both
        numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and was liable to produce in every generation strong
        characters of peculiar habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities,
        however, were now rather tolerated (in the rich) than generally approved. The custom
        endured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the family as The Took, and of adding to
        his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim the Second, for instance.</p>
    <p> The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor of Michel Delving (or of the
        Shire), who was elected every seven years at the Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe,
        that is at Midsummer. As mayor almost his only duty was to preside at banquets, given on the
        Shire-holidays, which occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of Postmaster and
        First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he managed both the Messenger Service
        and the Watch. These were the only Shire-services, and the Messengers were the most
        numerous, and much the busier of the two. By no means all Hobbits were lettered, but those
        who were wrote constantly to all their friends (and a selection of their relations) who
        lived further off than an afternoon's walk.</p>
    <p> The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their police, or the nearest equivalent
        that they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms (such things being quite unknown),
        only a feather in their caps; and they were in practice rather haywards than policemen, more
        concerned with the strayings of beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only
        twelve of them, three in each Farthing, for Inside Work. A rather larger body, varying at
        need, was employed to<quote> 'beat the bounds',</quote> and to see that Outsiders of any
        kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance.</p>
    <p> At the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they were called, had been greatly
        increased. There were many reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures prowling
        about the borders, or over them: the first sign that all was not quite as it should be, and
        always had been except in tales and legends of long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even
        Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty years had passed since he set out on
        his memorable journey, and he was old even for Hobbits, who reached a hundred as often as
        not; but much evidently still remained of the considerable wealth that he had brought back.
        How much or how little he revealed to no one, not even to Frodo his favourite<quote>
            'nephew'.</quote> And he still kept secret the ring that he bad found.</p>

    <p> As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great Wizard, Gandalf the
        Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant
        of kings, and his twelve companions in exile. With them he set out, to his own lasting
        astonishment, on a morning of April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest
        of great treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale,
        far off in the East. The quest was successful, and the Dragon that guarded the hoard was
        destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle of Five Armies was fought, and Thorin
        was slain, and many deeds of renown were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned
        later history, or earned more than a note in the long annals of the Third Age, but for
            an<quote> 'accident' </quote>by the way. The party was assailed by Orcs in a high pass
        of the Misty Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was
        lost for a while in the black orc-mines deep under the mountains, and there, as he groped in
        vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the floor of a tunnel. He put it in
        his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck.</p>
    <p> Trying to find his way out. Bilbo went on down to the roots of the mountains, until he could
        go no further. At the bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light, and on an
        island of rock in the water lived Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a
        small boat with his large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish
        with his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate any living thing, even orc, if he could
        catch it and strangle it without a struggle. He possessed a secret treasure that had come to
        him long ages ago, when he still lived in the light: a ring of gold that made its wearer
        invisible. It was the one thing he loved, his<quote> 'precious',</quote> and he talked to
        it, even when it was not with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island,
        except when he was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines.</p>
    <p> Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him when they met; but
        it was not, and the hobbit held in his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as a sword. So
        to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle
        which Bilbo could not guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if Bilbo defeated him,
        then he would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.</p>
    <p> Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor back. Bilbo accepted
        the challenge; and they asked one another many riddles. In the end Bilbo won the game, more
        by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and
        cried out, as his hand came upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten: _What haw I got in
        my pocket?_ This Gollum failed to answer, though he demanded three guesses.</p>
    <p> The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a mere<quote> 'question'
        </quote>and not a<quote> 'riddle' </quote>according to the strict rules of the Game; but all
        agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer, Gollum was bound by his
        promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; for the thought came to him that this slimy
        creature might prove false, even though such promises were held sacred, and of old all but
        the wickedest things feared to break them. But after ages alone in the dark Gollum's heart
        was black, and treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to the island, of which
        Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There, he thought, lay his ring. He was
        hungry now, and angry, and once his<quote> 'precious' </quote>was with him he would not fear
        any weapon at all.</p>
    <p> But the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was gone. His screech sent a shiver
        down Bilbo's back, though he did not yet understand what had happened. But Gollum had at
        last leaped to a guess, too late. _What has it got in its pocketses?_ he cried. The light in
        his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his<quote>
            'precious'.</quote> Just in time Bilbo saw his peril, and he fled blindly up the passage
        away from the water; and once more he was saved by his luck. For just as he ran he put his
        hand in his pocket, and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger. So it was that Gollum
        passed him without seeing him, and went to guard the way out, lest the<quote> 'thief'
        </quote>should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to
        himself about his<quote> 'precious';</quote> from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed the
        truth, and hope came to him in the darkness: he himself had found the marvellous ring and a
        chance of escape from the orcs and from Gollum.</p>
    <p> At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gates of the
        mines, on the eastward side of the mountains. There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling and
        listening; and Bilbo was tempted to slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, and though
        he kept the ring, in which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill the
        wretched creature at a disadvantage. In the end, gathering his courage, he leaped over
        Gollum in the dark, and fled away down the passage, pursued by his enemy's cries of hate and
        despair: _Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it for ever!_</p>

    <p> Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told it to his
        companions. To them his account was that Gollum had promised to give him a _present,_ if he
        won the game; but when Gollum went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure was
        gone: a magic ring, which had been given to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that
        this was the very ring that he had found, and as he had won the game, it was already his by
        right. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum show him the
        way out, as a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo set down in his memoirs, and
        he seems never to have altered it himself, not even after the Council of Elrond. Evidently
        it still appeared in the original Red Book, as it did in several of the copies and
        abstracts. But many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no doubt
        from notes by Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though they seem to have
        been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit himself.</p>
    <p> Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard it, and he continued
        to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much
        questioning, which for a while strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think the
        truth important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and
        disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first: quite
        contrary to his habit. The idea of a<quote> 'present' </quote>was not mere hobbitlike
        invention, all the same. It was suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum's talk that
        he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his<quote> 'birthday present',</quote>
        many times. That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the
        truth in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this book.</p>

    <p> Of Bilbo's later adventures little more need be said here. With the help of the ring he
        escaped from the orc-guards at the gate and rejoined his companions. He used the ring many
        times on his quest, chiefly for the help of his friends; but he kept it secret from them as
        long as he could. After his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save
        Gandalf and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he believed.
        Only to Frodo did he show the account of his Journey that he was writing.</p>
    <p> His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his coat of marvellous mail, the gift
        of the Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard, he lent to a museum, to the Michel Delving
        Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer at Bag End the old cloak and hood that he had
        worn on his travels; and the ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his pocket.</p>
    <p> He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in his fifty-second year (S.R. 1342),
        and nothing very notable occurred in the Shire until Mr. Baggins began the preparations for
        the celebration of his hundred-and-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point this History
        begins.</p>

    <p> At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great events that led to
        the inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread
        interest in their own history; and many of their traditions, up to that time still mainly
        oral, were collected and Written down. The greater families were also concerned with events
        in the Kingdom at large, and many of their members studied its ancient histories and
        legends. By the end of the first century of the Fourth Age there were already to be found in
        the Shire several libraries that contained many historical books and records.</p>
    <p> The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great Smials, and at
        Brandy Hall. This account of the end of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of
        Westmarch. That most important source for the history of the War of the Ring was so called
        because it was long preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns, Wardens of the
        Westmarch. It was in origin Bilbo's private diary, which he took with him to Rivendell.
        Frodo brought it back to the Shire, together with many loose leaves of notes, and during
        S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages with his account of the War. But annexed to it and
        preserved with it, probably m a single red case, were the three large volumes, bound in red
        leather, that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there was added in
        Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other matter concerning
        the hobbit members of the Fellowship.</p>
    <p> The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were made, especially of the
        first volume, for the use of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise. The most
        important copy, however, has a different history. It was kept at Great Smials, but it was
        written in Condor, probably at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and completed
        in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this note: Findegil, King's Writer,
        finished this work in IV 172. It is an exact copy in all details of the Thain's Book m Minas
        Tirith. That book was a copy, made at the request of King Elessar, of the Red Book of the
        Periannath, and was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV
        64.</p>
    <p> The Thain's Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and contained much that was
        later omitted or lost. In Minas Tirith it received much annotation, and many corrections,
        especially of names, words, and quotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to
        it an abbreviated version of those parts of _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_ which lie
        outside the account of the War. The full tale is stated to have been written by Barahir,
        grandson of the Steward Faramir, some time after the passing of the King. But the chief
        importance of Findegil's copy is that it alone contains the whole of Bilbo's<quote>
            'Translations from the Elvish'.</quote> These three volumes were found to be a work of
        great skill and learning in which, between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources
        available to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they were little used by
        Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them
        here.</p>
    <p> Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families, and at the same time
        kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough
        contained much that did not appear in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works
        dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or begun by
        Meriadoc himself, though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his _Herblore of the
        Shire,_ and for his _Reckoning of Years_ m which he discussed the relation of the calendars
        of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and Rohan. He also wrote a short
        treatise on _Old Words and Names in the Shire,_ having special interest in discovering the
        kinship with the language of the Rohirrim of such<quote> 'shire-words' </quote>as _mathom_
        and old elements in place names.</p>
    <p> At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk, though more important for
        larger history. None of them was written by Peregrin, but he and his successors collected
        many manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor: mainly copies or summaries of histories or
        legends relating to Elendil and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive
        materials for the history of N�menor and the arising of Sauron. It was probably at Great
        Smials that _The Tale of Years_ was put together, with the assistance of material collected
        by Meriadoc. Though the dates given are often conjectural, especially for the Second Age,
        they deserve attention. It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information
        from Rivendell, which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond had departed, his sons
        long remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. It is said that Celeborn went to
        dwell there after the departure of Galadriel; but there is no record of the day when at last
        he sought the Grey Havens, and with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in
        Middle-earth.</p>

    <p> A Long-expected Party</p>

    <p> When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his
        eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and
        excitement in Hobbiton.</p>
    <p> Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years,
        ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought
        back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever
        the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure.
        And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time
        wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same
        as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him _well_-preserved, but _unchanged_ would
        have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too
        much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual
        youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It will have to be paid for,' </quote>they said.<quote> 'It isn't natural, and
            trouble will come of it!'</quote></p>
    <p> But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people
        were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms
        with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted
        admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends,
        until some of his younger cousins began to grow up.</p>
    <p> The eldest of these, and Bilbo's favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was
        ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes
        of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same
        birthday, September 22nd.<quote> 'You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,'
        </quote>said Bilbo one day;<quote> 'and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties
            comfortably together.' </quote>At that time Frodo was still in his _tweens,_ as the
        hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at
        thirty-three.</p>


    <p> Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined
        birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was
        being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be _eleventy-one,_ 111, a rather curious
        number and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130);
        and Frodo was going to be _thirty-three,_ 33) an important number: the date of his<quote>
            'coming of age'.</quote></p>
    <p> Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all
        over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief
        topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome
        demand.</p>
    <p> No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He
        held forth at _The Ivy Bush_, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some
        authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old
        Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the
        joints, the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son
        were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3
        Bagshot Row just below Bag End.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I've always said,'
        </quote>the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to him, calling
            him<quote> 'Master Hamfast',</quote> and consulting him constantly upon the growing of
        vegetables � in the matter of<quote> 'roots',</quote> especially potatoes, the Gaffer was
        recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself).</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But what about this Frodo that lives with him?' </quote>asked Old Noakes of
            Bywater.<quote> 'Baggins is his name, but he's more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It
            beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in
            Buckland, where folks are so queer.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And no wonder they're queer,' </quote>put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer's next-door
            neighbour),<quote> 'if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River, and right
            agin the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half the tales be true.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You're right, Dad!' </quote>said the Gaffer.<quote> 'Not that the Brandybucks of
            Buck-land live _in_ the Old Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They fool
            about with boats on that big river � and that isn't natural. Small wonder that trouble
            came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you
            could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all his
            father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never
            much to tell of him, till he was drownded.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Drownded?' </quote>said several voices. They had heard this and other darker
        rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were
        ready to hear it again.<quote> 'Well, so they say,' </quote>said the Gaffer.<quote> 'You
            see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo's first
            cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took's daughters);
            and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first _and_ second cousin, once
            removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at
            Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his
            marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous
            table); and he went out _boating_on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were
            drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all. '</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' </quote>said Old
            Noakes;<quote> 'and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And _I_ heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,' </quote>said
        Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You shouldn't listen to all you hear, Sandyman,' </quote>said the Gaffer, who did
        not much like the miller. 'There isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats
        are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of
        trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say,
        among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by
        all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the
        place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among
        decent folk.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They thought they
            were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. And
            then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never
            looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers
            made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won't never see the inside of Bag End now, or
            it is to be hoped not.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,' </quote>said a
        stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing.<quote> 'All the top
            of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, _and_jools, by
            what I've heard. '</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then you've heard more than I can speak to,' </quote>answered the Gaffer. I know
        nothing about _jools._ Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but
        I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago,
        when I was a lad. I'd not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but
        he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the
        garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a
        pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don't doubt they were mostly full of
        treasure he had picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but
        there wasn't enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He's in and
        out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo's
        tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters � meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm
        will come of it.</p>
    <p> _'Elves and Dragons'_ I says to him.<quote> '_Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and
            you. Don't go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you'll land in
            trouble too big for you,'_I says to him. And I might say it to others,' </quote>he added
        with a look at the stranger and the miller.</p>
    <p> But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo's wealth was now too
        firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,'
        </quote>argued the miller, voicing common opinion.<quote> 'He's often away from home. And
            look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old
            wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End's a
            queer place, and its folk are queerer.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And you can say _what you_ like, about what you know no more of than you do of
            boating, Mr. Sandyman,' </quote>retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even more than
        usual. If that's being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts.
        There's some not far away that wouldn't offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a
        hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that _everyone's_
        going to be invited to the party, and there's going to be presents, mark you, presents for
        all � this very month as is.'</p>

    <p> That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or two later a rumour
        (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going to be
        fireworks � fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a
        century, not indeed since the Old Took died.</p>
    <p> Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages
        rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits
        peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange
        songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the
        end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of the
        Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all alone. He wore a tall
        pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy
        eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart
        all through Hobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly
        guessed. At Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great bundles of
        fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G and the elf-rune, .</p>

    <p> That was Gandalf's mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in
        the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real business was
        far more difficult and dangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was
        just one of the<quote> 'attractions' </quote>at the Party. Hence the excitement of the
            hobbit-children.<quote> 'G for Grand!' </quote>they shouted, and the old man smiled.
        They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped
        long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework
        displays � they now belonged to the legendary past.</p>
    <p> When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished unloading. Bilbo gave a few
        pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of
        the onlookers.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Run away now!' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'You will get plenty when the time
            comes.' </quote>Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was shut. The young
        hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, feeling that the day of
        the party would never come.</p>

    <p> Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking
        out west on to the garden. The late afternoon was bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed
        red and golden: snap-dragons and sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf
        walls and peeping in at the round windows.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'How bright your garden looks!' </quote>said Gandalf.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes,' </quote>said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old
        Shire; but I think I need a holiday.'</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You mean to go on with your plan then?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven't changed it.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan � your whole plan,
            mind � and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and for all of us.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little
            joke.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Who will laugh, I wonder?' </quote>said Gandalf, shaking his head.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We shall see,' </quote>said Bilbo.</p>

    <p> The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There might have been some
        grumbling about<quote> 'dealing locally',</quote> but that very week orders began to pour
        out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in
        Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they
        began to tick off the days on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping
        for invitations.</p>
    <p> Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and
        the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for.
        There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite
        variations on _Thank you, I shall certainly come._</p>
    <p> A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS. Even those
        who had, or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy:
        writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some private
        preparations of his own. From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from
        view.</p>
    <p> One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo's front door, covered
        with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank
        leading to the road, and wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The three
        hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally
        envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden.</p>
    <p> The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big that the tree that
        grew in the field was right inside it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of the
        chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits'
        mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. A draught
        of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the
        dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to its
        height.</p>
    <p> Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party. Anxiety was
        intense. Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds
        vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.</p>
    <p> Bilbo Baggins called it a _party,_ but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into
        one. Practically everybody living near was invited. A very few were overlooked by accident,
        but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the
        Shire were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met the
        guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. He gave away presents to all and
        sundry � the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the
        gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones,
        as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in
        Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebody's birthday, so that every hobbit
        in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But they
        never got tired of them.</p>
    <p> On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so excited that
        for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were toys the like of which they had
        never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of them had indeed been
        ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of
        real dwarf-make.</p>
    <p> When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, there were songs,
        dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink. There were three official meals:
        lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that
        at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together. At other times there
        were merely lots of people eating and drinking � continuously from elevenses until
        six-thirty, when the fireworks started.</p>
    <p> The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by
        him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But
        there was also a generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers,
        torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. They were all
        superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.</p>
    <p> There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. There
        were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring
        unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the
        astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned
        faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were
        pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx
        of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a
        forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled
        army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there
        was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as
        Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a
        mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet
        flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon � not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from
        his jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the heads
        of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an
        express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is the signal for supper!' </quote>said Bilbo. The pain and alarm vanished at
        once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There was a splendid supper for
        everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited to the special family dinner-party.
        This was held in the great pavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve
        dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered
        proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo
        and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as
        Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits
        were easy-going with their children in the matter of sitting up late, especially when there
        was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of
        provender.</p>
    <p> There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and Brandybucks; there were
        various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins' grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of
        his Took grandfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses,
        Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly connected
        with Bilbo, and some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in
        remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wife
        Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the
        invitation card, written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse.
        Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years and his table had
        a high reputation.</p>
    <p> All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather
        dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in
        bits of what he called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to the
        absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a
        _very_ pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and
        prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the
        ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo's catering had depleted the stocks of most stores, cellars and
        warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.</p>
    <p> After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company were, however, now in a
        tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they called<quote> 'filling up the
            corners'.</quote> They were sipping their favourite drinks, and nibbling at their
        favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. They were prepared to listen to
        anything, and to cheer at every full stop.</p>
    <p> _My dear People,_ began Bilbo, rising in his place.<quote> 'Hear! Hear! Hear!' </quote>they
        shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to follow their own advice.
        Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of
        the lanterns fell on his beaming face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk
        waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the other was in his
        trouser-pocket.</p>
    <p> _My dear Bagginses and Boffins,_ he began again; _and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and
        Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies,
        Brockhouses and Proudfoots._<quote> 'ProudFEET!' </quote>shouted an elderly hobbit from the
        back of the pavilion. His name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were
        large, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.</p>
    <p> _Proudfoots,_ repeated Bilbo. _Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last
        to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today!_<quote>
            'Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!' </quote>they shouted, and they hammered joyously
        on the tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and
        obvious.</p>
    <p> _I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am._ Deafening cheers. Cries of _Yes_
        (and _No)._ Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical instruments.
        There were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had
        been pulled. Most of them bore the mark DALE on them; which did not convey much to most of
        the hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained instruments,
        small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of the young
        Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished (since he had plainly said all
        that was necessary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master
        Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began
        to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.</p>
    <p> But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he blew three loud
        hoots. The noise subsided. _I shall not keep you long,_ he cried. Cheers from all the
        assembly. _I have called you all together for a Purpose._ Something in the way that he said
        this made an impression. There was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up
        their ears.</p>
    <p> _Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all,
        and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable
        hobbits._ Tremendous outburst of approval.</p>
    <p> _I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you
        half as well as you deserve._ This was unexpected and rather difficult. There was some
        scattered clapping, but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a
        compliment.</p>
    <p> _Secondly, to celebrate my birthday._ Cheers again. _I should say: OUR birthday. For it is,
        of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into his
        inheritance today._ Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of<quote>
            'Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,' </quote>from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses
        scowled, and wondered what was meant by<quote> 'coming into his inheritance'.</quote>
        _Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit this
        remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression._ No cheers. This was ridiculous.
        Many of his guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they
        had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package.<quote> 'One
            Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.'</quote></p>
    <p> _It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my arrival
        by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact that it was_ my _birthday slipped my
        memory on that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important.
        The banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and
        could only say<quote> 'thag you very buch'.</quote> I now repeat it more correctly: Thank
        you very much for coming to my little party._ Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song
        or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting bored. Why couldn't he stop talking
        and let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment.</p>
    <p> _Thirdly and finally,_ he said, _I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT_. He spoke this last word so
        loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. _I regret to announce that �
        though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you � this is
        the END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!_</p>
    <p> He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and the guests all
        blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and
        forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet
        from the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several
        deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger,
        Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.</p>
    <p> It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink were
        needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance.<quote> 'He's mad. I always said so,'
        </quote>was probably the most popular comment. Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions)
        thought Bilbo's behaviour was absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that
        his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.</p>
    <p> But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his
        wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda:<quote> 'There's something fishy in
            this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry?
            He hasn't taken the vittles with him.' </quote>He called loudly to Frodo to send the
        wine round again.</p>
    <p> Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he had sat silent beside
        Bilbo's empty chair, and ignored all remarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of
        course, even though he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at
        the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he
        realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and
        drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins' oddities, past and present; but the
        Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want to have any more to do
        with the party. He gave orders for more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his
        own glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.</p>
    <p> As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been fingering the golden
        ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped
        down he slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again.</p>
    <p> He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din
        in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went
        in. He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered
        silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and
        fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered
        black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took out an old
        cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were very precious, but they were so
        patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have
        been dark green. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his study, and from a
        large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a leather-bound manuscript;
        and also a large bulky envelope. The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag
        that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring,
        and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the
        mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that moment the door
        opened and Gandalf came quickly in.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Hullo!' </quote>said Bilbo.<quote> 'I wondered if you would turn up.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I am glad to find you visible,' </quote>replied the wizard, sitting down in a
            chair,<quote> 'I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel that
            everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, I do,' </quote>said Bilbo. "Though that flash was surprising: it quite
        startled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, I suppose?'</p>
    <p> It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it seemed to me necessary
        to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.'</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,' </quote>laughed
            Bilbo,<quote> 'but I expect you know best, as usual.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I do � when I know anything. But I don't feel too sure about this whole affair. It
            has now come to the final point. You have had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of
            your relations, and given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine days, or
            ninety-nine more likely. Are you going any further?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> 'Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have told you before.
        Probably a permanent holiday: I don't expect I shall return. In fact, I don't mean to, and I
        have made all arrangements.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I am old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of
            hearts. _Well-preserved_ indeed!' </quote>he snorted.<quote> 'Why, I feel all thin, sort
            of _stretched,_ if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much
            bread. That can't be right. I need a change, or something.'</quote></p>
    <p> Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him.<quote> 'No, it does not seem right,' </quote>he
        said thoughtfully.<quote> 'No, after all I believe your plan is probably the
        best.'</quote></p>
    <p> 'Well, I've made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, Gandalf, _mountains,_
        and then find somewhere where I can _rest._ In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives
        prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might find
        somewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: _and he lived
        happily ever after to the end of his days. '_</p>
    <p> Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however it ends.'</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as it has gone.
            You'll keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, I will � two eyes, as often as I can spare them.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered to once, just
            before the party. But he does not really want to, yet. I want to see the wild country
            again before I die, and the Mountains; but he is still in love with the Shire, with
            woods and fields and little rivers. He ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving
            everything to him, of course, except a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he
            gets used to being on his own. It's time he was his own master now.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Everything?' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'The ring as well? You agreed to that,
            you remember.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,' </quote>stammered Bilbo.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Where is it?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'In an envelope, if you must know,' </quote>said Bilbo impatiently.<quote> 'There on
            the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!' </quote>He hesitated.<quote> 'Isn't
            that odd now?' </quote>he said softly to himself.<quote> 'Yet after all, why not? Why
            shouldn't it stay there?'</quote></p>
    <p> Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes.<quote> 'I think,
            Bilbo,' </quote>he said quietly,<quote> 'I should leave it behind. Don't you want
            to?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well yes � and no. Now it comes to it, I don't like parting with it at all, I may
            say. And I don't really see why I should. Why do you want me to?' </quote>he asked, and
        a curious change came over his voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance.<quote> 'You
            are always badgering me about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other
            things that I got on my journey.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No, but I had to badger you,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'I wanted the truth. It
            was important. Magic rings are � well, magical; and they are rare and curious. I was
            professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I still am. I should like to
            know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think _you_have had it quite long
            enough. You won't need it any more. Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.'</quote></p>
    <p> Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard.<quote>
            'Why not?' </quote>he cried.<quote> 'And what business is it of yours, anyway, to know
            what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It came to me.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, yes,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'But there is no need to get
            angry.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'If I am it is your fault,' </quote>said Bilbo.<quote> 'It is mine, I tell you. My
            own. My precious. Yes, my precious.'</quote></p>
    <p> The wizard's face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed
        that he was startled and indeed alarmed.<quote> 'It has been called that before,' </quote>he
            said,<quote> 'but not by you.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It's not his now,
            but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly.<quote> 'You will be a fool if you do. Bilbo,' </quote>he
            said.<quote> 'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much
            hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be free.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I'll do as I choose and go as I please,' </quote>said Bilbo obstinately.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now, now, my dear hobbit! ' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'All your long life we
            have been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it up!
            '</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!' </quote>cried Bilbo.<quote> 'But you
            won't get it. I won't give my precious away, I tell you.' </quote>His hand strayed to
        the hilt of his small sword.</p>
    <p> Gandalf's eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said. If you say that
        again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.' He took a step towards the
        hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.</p>
    <p> Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pocket. They stood
        for a while facing one another, and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf's eyes remained
        bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I don't know what has come over you, Gandalf,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'You have
            never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn't it? I found it, and
            Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn't kept it. I'm not a thief, whatever he
            said.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I have never called you one,' </quote>Gandalf answered.<quote> 'And I am not one
            either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust me, as you
            used.' </quote>He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to dwindle again to an
        old grey man, bent and troubled.</p>
    <p> Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,' he said.<quote> 'But I felt so queer. And
            yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. It has been so
            growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I
            am always wanting to put it on and disappear, don't you know; or wondering if it is
            safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn't
            rest without it in my pocket. I don't know why. And I don't seem able to make up my
            mind.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then trust mine,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'It is quite made up. Go away and
            leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after
            him.'</quote></p>
    <p> Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed.<quote> 'All right,'
        </quote>he said with an effort. I will.' Then he shrugged his shoulders, and smiled rather
            ruefully.<quote> 'After all that's what this party business was all about, really: to
            give away lots of birthday presents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at the
            same time. It hasn't made it any easier in the end, but it would be a pity to waste all
            my preparations. It would quite spoil the joke.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,' </quote>said
        Gandalf.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Very well,' </quote>said Bilbo,<quote> 'it goes to Frodo with all the rest.'
        </quote>He drew a deep breath.<quote> 'And now I really must be starting, or somebody else
            will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn't bear to do it all over again.'
        </quote>He picked up his bag and moved to the door.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You have still got the ring in your pocket,' </quote>said the wizard.<quote> 'Well,
            so I have!' </quote>cried Bilbo.<quote> 'And my will and all the other documents too.
            You had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No, don't give the ring to me,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'Put it on the
            mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait for
            him.'</quote></p>
    <p> Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the clock, his hand
        jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. Before he could pick it up, the wizard
        stooped and seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the
        hobbit's face again. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh.<quote> 'Well,
            that's that,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Now I'm off!'</quote></p>
    <p> They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand; then he
        whistled. Three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Is everything ready?' </quote>asked Bilbo.<quote> 'Everything packed and
            labelled?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Everything,' </quote>they answered.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, let's start then!' </quote>He stepped out of the front-door.</p>
    <p> It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked up, sniffing the
            air.<quote> 'What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is
            what I have really been longing for, for years! Good-bye! ' </quote>he said, looking at
        his old home and bowing to the door.<quote> 'Good-bye, Gandalf!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and
            perhaps wise enough.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Take care! I don't care. Don't you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have ever
            been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. I am being swept off my
            feet at last,' </quote>he added, and then in a low voice, as if to himself, he sang
        softly in the dark:</p>

    <p> The Road goes ever on and on</p>
    <p> Down from the door where it began.</p>
    <p> Now far ahead the Road has gone,</p>
    <p> And I must follow, if I can,</p>
    <p> Pursuing it with eager feet,</p>
    <p> Until it joins some larger way</p>
    <p> Where many paths and errands meet.</p>
    <p> And whither then? I cannot say.</p>

    <p> He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned away from the lights and
        voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his three companions went round into his
        garden, and trotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a low place in the hedge at
        the bottom, and took to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the
        grass.</p>
    <p> Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness.<quote> 'Goodbye, my dear
            Bilbo � until our next meeting!' </quote>he said softly and went back indoors.</p>
    <p> Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep in thought.<quote>
            'Has he gone?' </quote>he asked.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes,' </quote>answered Gandalf,<quote> 'he has gone at last.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> ' I wish � I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,' </quote>said
            Frodo.<quote> 'But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. He always used to joke
            about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just to see him off.'</quote></p>
    <p> I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,' said Gandalf.<quote> 'Don't be
            too troubled. He'll be all right � now. He left a packet for you. There it
        is!'</quote></p>
    <p> Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open it.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You'll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,' </quote>said
        the wizard.<quote> 'You are the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, you'll find a
            golden ring.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The ring!' </quote>exclaimed Frodo.<quote> 'Has he left me that? I wonder why.
            Still, it may be useful.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It may, and it may not,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'I should not make use of it,
            if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.'</quote></p>
    <p> As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests. Rumours
        of strange events had by now spread all over the field, but Frodo would only say _no doubt
        everything will be cleared up in the morning_. About midnight carriages came for the
        important folk. One by one they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits.
        Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheel-barrows those that had inadvertently
        remained behind.</p>
    <p> Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went on. People
        came and began (by orders) to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and
        the spoons and knives and bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in
        boxes, and the crumbs and cracker-paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs,
        and the uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number of other people came (without
        orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that lived or were
        staying near. By mid-day, when even the best-fed were out and about again, there was a large
        crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not unexpected.</p>
    <p> Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and worried. He welcomed
        all the callers, but he had not much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries was
        simply this:<quote> 'Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.'
        </quote>Some of the visitors he invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left<quote> 'messages'
        </quote>for them.</p>
    <p> Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small
        articles of furniture. On every item there was a label tied. There were several labels of
        this sort:</p>
    <p> _For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo,_ on an umbrella. Adelard had carried off
        many unlabelled ones.</p>
    <p> _For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo,_ on a large
        waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo's sister and the eldest surviving female relative of
        Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than
        half a century.</p>
    <p> _For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.,_ on a gold pen and ink-bottle. Milo
        never answered letters.</p>
    <p> _For ANGELICA'S use, from Uncle Bilbo,_ on a round convex mirror. She was a young Baggins,
        and too obviously considered her face shapely.</p>
    <p> _For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor,_ on an (empty) book-case. Hugo
        was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual at returning them.</p>
    <p> _For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT,_ on a case of silver spoons. Bilbo believed
        that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, while he was away on his former journey.
        Lobelia knew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took the point at once,
        but she also took the spoons.</p>
    <p> This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo's residence had got rather
        cluttered up with things in the course of his long life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes
        to get cluttered up: for which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely
        responsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always _new,_ there were one or
        two old _mathoms_ of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; but Bilbo
        had usually given new presents, and kept those that he received. The old hole was now being
        cleared a little.</p>
    <p> Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out personally by Bilbo, and
        several had some point, or some joke. But, of course, most of the things were given where
        they would be wanted and welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot Row,
        did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen
        waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for
        much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the
        Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by Bilbo's father. Rory quite
        forgave Bilbo, and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle.</p>
    <p> There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the chief treasures, as
        well as the books, pictures, and more than enough furniture, were left in his possession.
        There was, however, no sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or a glass
        bead was given away.</p>
    <p> Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the whole household was
        being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before long the place was packed with
        people who had no business there, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed,
        and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others
        tried to make _off_ with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed
        unwanted or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts.</p>
    <p> In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo had retired for a
        while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly
        demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'He is indisposed,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'He is resting.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Hiding, you mean,' </quote>said Lobelia.<quote> 'Anyway we want to see him and we
            mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!'</quote></p>
    <p> Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover their parting gift
        of spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually they were shown into the study.
        Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him. He looked indisposed � to
        see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his
        pocket. But he spoke quite politely.</p>
    <p> The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering him bad bargain-prices
        (as between friends) for various valuable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that
        only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole
        affair was very fishy.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Only one thing is clear to me,' </quote>said Otho,<quote> 'and that is that you are
            doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.'</quote></p>
    <p> Otho would have been Bilbo's heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. He read the will carefully
        and snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and correct (according to the legal customs
        of hobbits, which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink).</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Foiled again!' </quote>he said to his wife.<quote> 'And after waiting _sixty_
            years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!' </quote>He snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and
        slumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out of the
        study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place, investigating
        nooks and comers and tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the premises, after he
        had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen
        inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really
        crushing parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You'll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn't you go too? You don't belong
            here; you're no Baggins � you � you're a Brandybuck!'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,' </quote>said Frodo as
        he shut the door on her.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It was a compliment,' </quote>said Merry Brandybuck,<quote> 'and so, of course, not
            true.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger)
        who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with
        young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the
        larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both
        curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively
        ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one's for the finding � unless the search is
        interrupted.</p>

    <p> THE TWO TOWERS</p>

    <p> _being the SECOND part of</p>
    <p> The Lord of the Rings_</p>

    <book b="2">BOOK II</book>

    <chapter>_Chapter 1_</chapter>
    <p> The Departure of Boromir</p>

    <p> Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light,
        and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to read, but not far from the top a
        spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I read the signs aright,' </quote>he said to himself.<quote> 'Frodo ran to the
            hill-top. I wonder what he saw there? But he returned by the same way, and went down the
            hill again.'</quote></p>
    <p> Aragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to see there something
        that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was pressing. Suddenly he leaped forward,
        and ran to the summit, across the great flag-stones, and up the steps. Then sitting in the
        high seat he looked out. But the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. He
        turned from the North back again to North, and saw nothing save the distant hills, unless it
        were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air, descending
        slowly in wide circles down towards the earth.</p>
    <p> Even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, on the west side of
        the River. He stiffened. There were cries, and among them, to his horror, he could
        distinguish the harsh voices of Orcs. Then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn
        blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty
        shout above the roaring of the falls.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The horn of Boromir!' </quote>he cried.<quote> 'He is in need!' </quote>He sprang
        down the steps and away, leaping down the path.<quote> 'Alas! An ill fate is on me this day,
            and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?'</quote></p>
    <p> As he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing.
        Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Orcs, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. Aragorn
        raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away;
        and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could
        hear them no more. Drawing his bright sword and crying _Elendil! Elendil!_ he crashed
        through the trees.</p>
    <p> A mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found Boromir. He
        was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. But Aragorn saw that he was
        pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken
        near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Orcs lay slain, piled all about
        him and at his feet.</p>
    <p> Aragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. At last slow words
            came.<quote> 'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo ' </quote>he said.<quote> 'I am sorry.
            I have paid.' </quote>His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at least lay
            there.<quote> 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken them. I think they are
            not dead. Orcs bound them.' </quote>He paused and his eyes closed wearily. After a
        moment he spoke again.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No!' </quote>said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow.<quote> 'You have
            conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall not
            fall!'</quote></p>
    <p> Boromir smiled.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?' </quote>said Aragorn.</p>
    <p> But Boromir did not speak again.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Alas!' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'Thus passes the heir of Denethor, Lord of the
            Tower of Guard! This is a bitter end. Now the Company is all in ruin. It is I that have
            failed. Vain was Gandalf's trust in me. What shall I do now? Boromir has laid it on me
            to go to Minas Tirith, and my heart desires it; but where are the Ring and the Bearer?
            How shall I find them and save the Quest from disaster?'</quote></p>
    <p> He knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir's hand. So it was that
        Legolas and Gimli found him. They came from the western slopes of the hill, silently,
        creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. Gimli had his axe in hand, and Legolas
        his long knife: all his arrows were spent. When they came into the glade they halted in
        amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them
        plain what had happened.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Alas!' </quote>said Legolas, coming to Aragorn's side.<quote> 'We have hunted and
            slain many Orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. We came when we
            heard the horn-but too late, it seems. I fear you have taken deadly hurt.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Boromir is dead,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'I am unscathed, for I was not here
            with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The hobbits!' </quote>cried Gimli<quote> 'Where are they then? Where is
            Frodo?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I do not know,' </quote>answered Aragorn wearily.<quote> 'Before he died Boromir
            told me that the Orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. I sent him
            to follow Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam were with him: not
            until it was too late. All that I have done today has gone amiss. What is to be done
            now?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'First we must tend the fallen,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'We cannot leave him
            lying like carrion among these foul Orcs.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But we must be swift,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'He would not wish us to linger.
            We must follow the Orcs, if there is hope that any of our Company are living
            prisoners.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them or not ' </quote>said
            Aragorn.<quote> 'Are we to abandon him? Must we not seek him first? An evil choice is
            now before us!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then let us do first what we must do,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'We have not
            the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A cairn
            we might build.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use nearer
            than the water-side,' </quote>said Gimli.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished
            foes,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and give
            him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil creature
            dishonours his bones.'</quote></p>
    <p> Quickly they searched the bodies of the Orcs, gathering their swords and cloven helms and
        shields into a heap.<quote> 'See!' </quote>cried Aragorn.<quote> 'Here we find tokens!'
        </quote>He picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in
        gold and red; and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red
            gems.<quote> 'No orc-tools these!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'They were borne by the
            hobbits. Doubtless the Orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them
            for what they are: work of Westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor.
            Well, now, if they still live, our friends are weaponless. I will take these things,
            hoping against hope, to give them back.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And I,' </quote>said Legolas,<quote> 'will take all the arrows that I can find, for
            my quiver is empty.' </quote>He searched in the pile and on the ground about and found
        not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the Orcs were
        accustomed to use. He looked at them closely.</p>
    <p> And Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said:<quote> 'Here lie many that are not folk of
            Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty Mountains, if I know anything of Orcs
            and their kinds. And here are others strange to me. Their gear is not after the manner
            of Orcs at all!'</quote></p>
    <p> There were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and
        large hands. They were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars
        usual with Orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men. Upon
        their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field;
        on the front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I have not seen these tokens before,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'What do they
            mean?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'S is for Sauron,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'That is easy to read.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nay!' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,'
        </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'And he does not use white. The Orcs in the service of
            Barad-d�r use the sign of the Red Eye.' </quote>He stood for a moment in thought.<quote>
            'S is for Saruman, I guess,' </quote>he said at length.<quote> 'There is evil afoot in
            Isengard, and the West is no longer safe. It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the
            traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's
            fall. Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the vigilance of L�rien, or they may have
            avoided that land and come to Isengard by other paths. Orcs travel fast. But Saruman has
            many ways of learning news. Do you remember the birds?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, we have no time to ponder riddles,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Let us bear
            Boromir away!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our course rightly,'
        </quote>answered Aragorn.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Maybe there is no right choice,' </quote>said Gimli.</p>
    <p> Taking his axe the Dwarf now cut several branches. These they lashed together with
        bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. Upon this rough bier they carried the
        body of their companion to the shore, together with such trophies of his last battle as they
        chose to send forth with him. It was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for
        Boromir was a man both tall and strong.</p>
    <p> At the water-side Aragorn remained, watching the bier. while Legolas and Gimli hastened back
        on foot to Parth Galen. It was a mile or more, and it was some time before they came back,
        paddling two boats swiftly along the shore.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There is a strange tale to tell!' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'There are only two
            boats upon the bank. We could find no trace of the other.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Have Orcs been there?' </quote>asked Aragorn.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We saw no signs of them,' </quote>answered Gimli.<quote> 'And Orcs would have taken
            or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will look at the ground when we come there,' </quote>said Aragorn.</p>
    <p> Now they laid Boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away. The grey hood and
        elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. They combed his long dark hair and
        arrayed it upon his shoulders. The golden belt of L�rien gleamed about his waist. His helm
        they set beside him, and across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards
        of his sword; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies. Then fastening the prow
        to the stern of the other boat, they drew him out into the water. They rowed sadly along the
        shore, and turning into the swift-running channel they passed the green sward of Parth
        Galen. The steep sides of Tol Brandir were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon. As they went
        south the fume of Rauros rose and shimmered before them, a haze of gold. The rush and
        thunder of the falls shook the windless air.</p>
    <p> Sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there Boromir lay, restful, peaceful, gliding
        upon the bosom of the flowing water. The stream took him while they held their own boat back
        with their paddles. He floated by them, and slowly his boat departed, waning to a dark spot
        against the golden light; and then suddenly it vanished. Rauros roared on unchanging. The
        River had taken Boromir son of Denethor, and he was not seen again in Minas Tirith, standing
        as he used to stand upon the White Tower in the morning. But in Gondor in after-days it long
        was said that the elven-boat rode the falls and the foaming pool, and bore him down through
        Osgiliath, and past the many mouths of Anduin, out into the Great Sea at night under the
        stars.</p>
    <p> For a while the three companions remained silent, gazing after him. Then Aragorn
            spoke.<quote> 'They will look for him from the White Tower,' </quote>he said,<quote>
            'but he will not return from mountain or from sea.' </quote>Then slowly he began to
        sing:</p>

    <p> Through Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows</p>
    <p> The West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes.</p>
    <p> 'What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight?</p>
    <p> Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?'</p>
    <p> 'I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey;</p>
    <p> I saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away</p>
    <p> Into the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more.</p>
    <p> The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor.'</p>
    <p> 'O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar,</p>
    <p> But you came not from the empty lands where no men are.'</p>

    <p> Then Legolas sang:</p>

    <p> From the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones;</p>
    <p> The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans.</p>
    <p> 'What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?</p>
    <p> Where now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.'</p>
    <p> 'Ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie</p>
    <p> On the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky;</p>
    <p> So many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing Sea.</p>
    <p> Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!'</p>
    <p> 'O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south,</p>
    <p> But you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea's mouth.'</p>

    <p> Then Aragorn sang again:</p>

    <p> From the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides, and past the roaring falls;</p>
    <p> And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls.</p>
    <p> 'What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me today?</p>
    <p> What news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.'</p>
    <p> 'Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought.</p>
    <p> His cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.</p>
    <p> His head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;</p>
    <p> And Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast.'</p>
    <p> 'O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze</p>
    <p> To Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days.'</p>

    <p> So they ended. Then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could
        against the stream back to Parth Galen.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You left the East Wind to me,' </quote>said Gimli,<quote> 'but I will say naught of
            it.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is as it should be,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'In Minas Tirith they endure
            the East Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. But now Boromir has taken his road.
            and we must make haste to choose our own.'</quote></p>
    <p> He surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping often to the earth.<quote> 'The
            Orcs have been on this ground,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Otherwise nothing can be made
            out for certain. All our footprints are here, crossing and re-crossing. I cannot tell
            whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for Frodo began.' </quote>He
        returned to the bank, close to where the rill from the spring trickled out into the
            River.<quote> 'There are some clear prints here,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'A hobbit
            waded out into the water and back; but I cannot say how long ago.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'How then do you read this riddle?' </quote>asked Gimli.</p>
    <p> Aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and looked at the
            baggage.<quote> 'Two packs are missing.' </quote>he said,<quote> 'and one is certainly
            Sam's: it was rather large and heavy. This then is the answer: Frodo has gone by boat,
            and his servant has gone with him. Frodo must have returned while we were all away. I
            met Sam going up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not do so. He
            guessed his master s mind and came back here before Frodo had gone. He did not find it
            easy to leave Sam behind!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' </quote>said Gimli.<quote>
            'That was a strange deed!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And a brave deed,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'Sam was right, I think. Frodo did
            not wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he knew that he must go
            himself. Something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and
        doubt.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled,' </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'He fled, certainly,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'but not, I think, from Orcs.'
        </quote>What he thought was the cause of Frodo's sudden resolve and flight Aragorn did not
        say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, so much at least is now clear,' </quote>said Legolas:<quote> 'Frodo is no
            longer on this side of the River: only he can have taken the boat. And Sam is with him;
            only he would have taken his pack.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Our choice then,' </quote>said Gimli,<quote> 'is either to take the remaining boat
            and follow Frodo, or else to follow the Orcs on foot. There is little hope either way.
            We have already lost precious hours.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Let me think!' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'And now may I make a right choice and
            change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' </quote>He stood silent for a moment.<quote>
            'I will follow the Orcs,' </quote>he said at last.<quote> 'I would have guided Frodo to
            Mordor and gone with him to the end; but if I seek him now in the wilderness, I must
            abandon the captives to torment and death. My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of
            the Bearer is in my hands no longer. The Company has played its part. Yet we that remain
            cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left. Come! We will go now. Leave
            all that can be spared behind! We will press on by day and dark!'</quote></p>
    <p> They drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees. They laid beneath it such of their
        goods as they did not need and could not carry away. Then they left Parth Galen. The
        afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where Boromir had fallen. There they
        picked up the trail of the Orcs. It needed little skill to find.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No other folk make such a trampling,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'It seems their
            delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their
        way.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But they go with a great speed for all that,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'and
            they do not tire. And later we may have to search for our path in hard bare
            lands.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, after them!' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Dwarves too can go swiftly, and they
            do not tire sooner than Orcs. But it will be a long chase: they have a long
            start.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'we shall all need the endurance of Dwarves. But
            come! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. And woe to
            them, if we prove the swifter! We will make such a chase as shall be accounted a marvel
            among the Three Kindreds : Elves. Dwarves, and Men. Forth the Three
        Hunters!'</quote></p>
    <p> Like a deer he sprang away. Through the trees he sped. On and on he led them, tireless and
        swift, now that his mind was at last made up. The woods about the lake they left behind.
        Long slopes they climbed, dark, hard-edged against the sky already red with sunset. Dusk
        came. They passed away, grey shadows in a stony land.</p>


    <chapter>_Chapter 2_</chapter>
    <p> The Riders of Rohan</p>

    <p> Dusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and brooded on the pale margins
        of the Anduin, but the sky was clear. Stars came out. The waxing moon was riding in the
        West, and the shadows of the rocks were black. They had come to the feet of stony hills, and
        their pace was slower, for the trail was no longer easy to follow. Here the highlands of the
        Emyn Muil ran from North to South in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of each ridge
        was steep and difficult, but the eastward slopes were gentler, furrowed with many gullies
        and narrow ravines. All night the three companions scrambled in this bony land, climbing to
        the crest of the first and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding
        valley on the other side.</p>
    <p> There in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. The moon had long
        gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the first light of day had not yet
        come over the dark hills behind. For the moment Aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had
        descended into the valley, but there it had vanished.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Which way would they turn, do you think?' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'Northward
            to take a straighter road to Isengard, or Fangorn, if that is their aim as you guess? Or
            southward to strike the Entwash?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'They will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at''</quote> said
            Aragorn.<quote> 'And unless there is much amiss in Rohan and the power of Saruman is
            greatly increased; they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of
            the Rohirrim. Let us search northwards!'</quote></p>
    <p> The dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a trickling stream flowed
        among the boulders at the bottom. A cliff frowned upon their right; to their left rose grey
        slopes, dim and shadowy in the late night. They went on for a mile or more northwards.
        Aragorn was searching. bent towards the ground, among the folds and gullies leading up into
        the western ridge. Legolas was some way ahead. Suddenly the Elf gave a cry and the others
        came running towards him.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' </quote>he
            said.<quote> 'Look!' </quote>He pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken
        to be boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. Five dead Orcs lay there.
        They had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been beheaded. The ground was wet
        with their dark blood.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Here is another riddle!' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'But it needs the light of day
            and for that we cannot wait.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote>
            'Enemies of the Orcs are likely to be our friends. Do any folk dwell in these
            hills?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'The Rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far
            from Minas Tirith. It might be that some company of Men were hunting here for reasons
            that we do not know. Yet I think not.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'What do you think?' </quote>said Gimli.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' </quote>answered
            Aragorn.<quote> 'These are Northern Orcs from far away. Among the slain are none of the
            great Orcs with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is no uncommon
            thing with these foul folk. Maybe there was some dispute about the road.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Or about the captives,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Let us hope that they, too, did
            not meet their end here.'</quote></p>
    <p> Aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of the fight could be
        found. They went on. Already the eastward sky was turning pale; the stars were fading, and a
        grey light was slowly growing. A little further north they came to a fold in which a tiny
        stream, falling and winding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. In it some bushes
        grew, and there were patches of grass upon its sides.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'At last!' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'Here are the tracks that we seek! Up this
            water-channel: this is the way that the Orcs went after their debate.'</quote></p>
    <p> Swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path. As if fresh from a night's rest
        they sprang from stone to stone. At last they reached the crest of the grey hill, and a
        sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn.</p>
    <p> Turning back they saw across the River the far hills kindled. Day leaped into the sky. The
        red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land. Before them in the West the
        world lay still, formless and grey; but even as they looked, the shadows of night melted,
        the colours of the waking earth returned: green flowed over the wide meads of Rohan; the
        white mists shimmered in the watervales; and far off to the left, thirty leagues or more,
        blue and purple stood the White Mountains, rising into peaks of jet, tipped with glimmering
        snows, flushed with the rose of morning.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Gondor! Gondor!' </quote>cried Aragorn. 'Would that I looked on you again in
        happier hour! Not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams.</p>

    <p> Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!</p>
    <p> West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree</p>
    <p> Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old.</p>
    <p> O proud walls! White towers! O winged crown and throne of gold!</p>
    <p> O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree,</p>
    <p> Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?</p>

    <p> Now let us go!' he said, drawing his eyes away from the South, and looking out west and
        north to the way that he must tread.</p>
    <p> The ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet. Below it
        twenty fathoms or more, there was a wide and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink
        of a sheer cliff: the East Wall of Rohan. So ended the Emyn Muil, and the green plains of
        the Rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Look!' </quote>cried Legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them.<quote>
            'There is the eagle again! He is very high. He seems to be flying now away, from this
            land back to the North. He is going with great speed. Look!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No, not even my eyes can see him, my good Legolas,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote>
            'He must be far aloft indeed. I wonder what is his errand, if he is the same bird that I
            have seen before. But look! I can see something nearer at hand and more urgent; there is
            something moving over the plain!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Many things,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'It is a great company on foot; but I
            cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. They are many leagues away:
            twelve, I guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way to go,'
        </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may
            be.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the Orcs chose,'
        </quote>said Aragorn.</p>
    <p> They followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. It seemed that the Orcs had
        pressed on with all possible speed. Every now and again the pursuers found things that had
        been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread. a torn black
        cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the stones. The trail led them north along the top
        of the escarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream
        that splashed noisily down. In the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair
        into the plain.</p>
    <p> At the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of Rohan. It swelled like a
        green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The falling stream vanished into a deep
        growth of cresses and water-plants, and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels,
        down long gentle slopes towards the fens of Entwash Vale far away. They seemed to have left
        winter clinging to the hills behind. Here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly
        scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf.
        Legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in barren
        places.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Ah! the green smell!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'It is better than much sleep. Let us
            run!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Light feet may run swiftly here,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'More swiftly,
            maybe, than iron-shod Orcs. Now we have a chance to lessen their lead!'</quote></p>
    <p> They went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an eager light was in
        their eyes. Nearly due west the broad swath of the marching Orcs tramped its ugly slot; the
        sweet grass of Rohan had been bruised and blackened as they passed. Presently Aragorn gave a
        cry and turned aside.<quote> 'Stay!' </quote>he shouted.<quote> 'Do not follow me yet!'
        </quote>He ran quickly to the right, away from the main trail; for he had seen footprints
        that went that way, branching off from the others, the marks of small unshod feet. These,
        however, did not go far before they were crossed by orc-prints, also coming out from the
        main trail behind and in front, and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the
        trampling. At the furthest point Aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass;
        then he ran back.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes,' </quote>he said, 'they are quite plain: a hobbit's footprints. Pippin's I
        think. He is smaller than the other. And look at this! He held up a thing that glittered in
        the sunlight. It looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that
        treeless plain.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The brooch of an elven-cloak!' </quote>cried Legolas and Gimli together.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Not idly do the leaves of L�rien fall,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'This did not
            drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. I think Pippin ran
            away from the trail for that purpose.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then he at least was alive,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'And he had the use of his
            wits, and of his legs too. That is heartening. We do not pursue in vain.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,' </quote>said
            Legolas.<quote> 'Come! Let us go on! The thought of those merry young folk driven like
            cattle burns my heart.'</quote></p>
    <p> The sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky. Light clouds came up out of
        the sea in the distant South and were blown away upon the breeze. The sun sank. Shadows rose
        behind and reached out long arms from the East. Still the hunters held on. One day now had
        passed since Boromir fell, and the Orcs were yet far ahead. No longer could any sight of
        them be seen in the level plains.</p>
    <p> As nightshade was closing about them Aragorn halted. Only twice in the day's march had they
        rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where
        they had stood at dawn.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We have come at last to a hard choice,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Shall we rest by
            night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we stay to sleep.'
        </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'Surely even Orcs must pause on the march?' </quote>said
            Gimli.<quote> 'Seldom will Orcs journey in the open under the sun. yet these have done
            so,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'Certainly they will not rest by night.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' </quote>said Gimli.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my eyes can
            see,' </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Maybe, I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,'
        </quote>said Aragorn;<quote> 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when light came
            there might be long delay before the trail was found again.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And there is this also,' </quote>said Gimli:<quote> 'only by day can we see if any
            tracks lead away. If a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried off,
            eastward, say, to the Great River, towards Mordor, we might pass the signs and never
            know it.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is true,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'But if I read the signs back yonder
            rightly, the Orcs of the White Hand prevailed, and the whole company is now bound for
            Isengard. Their present course bears me out.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'And
            what of escape? In the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the
            brooch.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The Orcs will be doubly on their guard since then, and the prisoners even wearier,'
        </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'There will be no escape again, if we do not contrive it. How
            that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must overtake them.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And yet even I, Dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my folk, cannot
            run all the way to Isengard without any pause ' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'My heart
            burns me too, and I would have started sooner but now I must rest a little to run the
            better. And if we rest, then the blind night is the time to do so.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I said that it was a hard choice,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'How shall we end
            this debate?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You are our guide,' </quote>said Gimli,<quote> 'and you are skilled in the chase.
            You shall choose.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'My heart bids me go on,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'But we must hold together. I
            will follow your counsel.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You give the choice to an ill chooser,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'Since we
            passed through the Argonath my choices have gone amiss.' </quote>He fell silent gazing
        north and west into the gathering night for a long while.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We will not walk in the dark,' </quote>he said at length.<quote> 'The peril of
            missing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater. If the
            Moon gave enough light, we would use it, but alas! he sets early and is yet young and
            pale.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And tonight he is shrouded anyway,' </quote>Gimli murmured.<quote> 'Would that the
            Lady had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to Frodo!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It will be more needed where it is bestowed,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'With
            him lies the true Quest. Ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time. A
            vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can mar or mend. Well, I
            have chosen. So let us use the time as best we may!'</quote></p>
    <p> He cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he had not slept since their
        night under the shadow of Tol Brandir. Before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose. Gimli
        was still deep in slumber, but Legolas was standing, gazing northwards into the darkness,
        thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'They are far far away,' </quote>he said sadly, turning to Aragorn.<quote> 'I know
            in my heart that they have not rested this night. Only an eagle could overtake them
            now.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nonetheless we will still follow as we may,' </quote>said Aragorn. Stooping he
        roused the Dwarf.<quote> 'Come! We must go,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'The scent is growing
            cold.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But it is still dark,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Even Legolas on a hill-top could
            not see them till the Sun is up.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon or sun,'
        </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'The
            land must groan under their hated feet.' </quote>He stretched himself upon the ground
        with his ear pressed against the turf. He lay there motionless, for so long a time that
        Gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again. Dawn came glimmering, and slowly a
        grey light grew about them. At last he rose, and now his friends could see his face: it was
        pale and drawn, and his look was troubled.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The rumour of the earth is dim and confused,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Nothing
            walks upon it for many miles about us. Faint and far are the feet of our enemies. But
            loud are the hoofs of the horses. It comes to my mind that I heard them, even as I lay
            on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams: horses galloping, passing in the
            West. But now they are drawing ever further from us, riding northward. I wonder what is
            happening in this land!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Let us go!' </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p> So the third day of their pursuit began. During all its long hours of cloud and fitful sun
        they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no weariness could quench the fire that
        burned them. They seldom spoke. Over the wide solitude they passed and their elven-cloaks
        faded against the background of the grey-green fields; even in the cool sunlight of mid-day
        few but elvish eyes would have marked them, until they were close at hand. Often in their
        hearts they thanked the Lady of L�rien for the gift of _lembas_, for they could eat of it
        and find new strength even as they ran.</p>
    <p> All day the track of their enemies led straight on, going north-west without a break or
        turn. As once again the day wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes, where the
        land rose, swelling up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew
        fainter as it bent north towards them, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter.
        Far away to the left the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. No moving
        thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man. The
        dwellings of the Rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to the South, under the
        wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now hidden in mist and cloud; yet the Horse-lords had
        formerly kept many herds and studs in the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm,
        and there the herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. But
        now all the land was empty, and there was silence that did not seem to be the quiet of
        peace.</p>

    <p> At dusk they halted again. Now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the plains of Rohan
        and the wall of the Emyn Muil was lost in the shadows of the East. The young moon was
        glimmering in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now do I most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' </quote>said
            Legolas.<quote> 'The Orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of Sauron were behind
            them. I fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, and even now are
            passing into the shadows of the trees.'</quote></p>
    <p> Gimli ground his teeth.<quote> 'This is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!'
        </quote>he said.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'To hope, maybe, but not to toil,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'We shall not turn
            back here. Yet I am weary.' </quote>He gazed back along the way that they had come
        towards the night gathering in the East.<quote> 'There is something strange at work in this
            land. I distrust the silence. I distrust even the pale Moon. The stars are faint; and I
            am weary as I have seldom been before, weary as no Ranger should be with a clear trail
            to follow. There is some will that lends speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier
            before us: a weariness that is in the heart more than in the limb.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Truly!' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'That I have known since first we came down
            from the Emyn Muil. For the will is not behind us but before us.' </quote>He pointed
        away over the land of Rohan into the darkling West under the sickle moon.<quote> 'Saruman!'
        </quote>muttered Aragorn.<quote> 'But he shall not turn us back! Halt we must once more;
            for, see! even the Moon is falling into gathering cloud. But north lies our road between
            down and fen when day returns.'</quote></p>
    <p> As before Legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept.<quote> 'Awake! Awake!'
        </quote>he cried.<quote> 'It is a red dawn. Strange things await us by the eaves of the
            forest. Good or evil, I do not know; but we are called. Awake!'</quote></p>
    <p> The others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the downs drew near. It
        was still an hour before noon when they reached them: green slopes rising to bare ridges
        that ran in a line straight towards the North. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf
        short, but a long strip of sunken land, some ten miles wide, lay between them and the river
        wandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. Just to the West of the southernmost slope
        there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet. From
        it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. Aragorn
        halted and examined the tracks closely.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'They rested here a while,' </quote>he said,<quote> 'but even the outward trail is
            already old. I fear that your heart spoke truly, Legolas: it is thrice twelve hours, I
            guess, since the Orcs stood where we now stand. If they held to their pace, then at
            sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of Fangorn.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' </quote>said
            Gimli.<quote> 'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is still far away,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'If I remember rightly, these
            downs run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the issuing of the
            Entwash there lies still a wide land. another fifteen leagues it may be.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, let us go on,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'My legs must forget the miles.
            They would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.'</quote></p>
    <p> The sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs. For many
        hours they had marched without rest. They were going slowly now, and Gimli's back was bent.
        Stone-hard are the Dwarves in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to tell on
        him, as all hope failed in his heart. Aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping
        now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped as
        lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no footprints as he
        passed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found all the sustenance that he needed, and he
        could sleep, if sleep it could be called by Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of
        elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Let us go up on to this green hill!' </quote>he said. Wearily they followed him,
        climbing the long slope, until they came out upon the top. It was a round hill smooth and
        bare, standing by itself, the most northerly of the downs. The sun sank and the shadows of
        evening fell like a curtain. They were alone in a grey formless world without mark or
        measure. Only far away north-west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light: the
        Mountains of Mist and the forest at their feet.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nothing can we see to guide us here,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Well, now we must
            halt again and wear the night away. It is growing cold!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The wind is north from the snows,' </quote>said Aragorn.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And ere morning it will be in the East,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'But rest if
            you must. Yet do not cast all hope away. Tomorrow is unknown. Rede oft is found at the
            rising of the Sun.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel ' </quote>said
        Gimli.</p>

    <p> The night grew ever colder. Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they
        saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his
        own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. So the
        night passed. Together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless,
        until at last the sunrise came. It was pale and clear. The wind was in the East and all the
        mists had rolled away; wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light.</p>
    <p> Ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that they had already
        glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North-westward stalked the dark forest of
        Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves, and its further slopes faded into
        the distant blue. Beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white
        head of tall Methedras, the last peak of the Misty Mountains. Out of the forest the Entwash
        flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. The
        orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.</p>
    <p> Following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river back towards the
        forest, Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark swift-moving blur. He cast himself
        upon the ground and listened again intently. But Legolas stood beside him, shading his
        bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the
        small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their
        spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. Far behind them
        a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.</p>
    <p> There was a silence in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air moving in the
        grass.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Riders!' </quote>cried Aragorn, springing to his feet.<quote> 'Many riders on swift
            steeds are coming towards us!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes,' </quote>said Legolas,<quote> 'there are one hundred and five. Yellow is their
            hair, and bright are their spears. Their leader is very tall.'</quote></p>
    <p> Aragorn smiled.<quote> 'Keen are the eyes of the Elves,' </quote>he said.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nay! The riders are little more than five leagues distant,' </quote>said
        Legolas.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Five leagues or one,' </quote>said Gimli;<quote> 'we cannot escape them in this
            bare land. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We will wait,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'I am weary, and our hunt has failed.
            Or at least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the
            orc-trail. We may get new s from them.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Or spears,' </quote>said Gimli.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There are three empty saddles, but I see no hobbits,' </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I did not say that we should hear good news,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'But
            evil or good we will await it here.'</quote></p>
    <p> The three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy mark against the
        pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope. A little above the hill's foot
        they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about them, they sat huddled together upon the faded
        grass. The time passed slowly and heavily. The wind was thin and searching. Gimli was
        uneasy.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'What do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Do we sit
            here waiting for sudden death?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I have been among them,' </quote>answered Aragorn.<quote> 'They are proud and
            wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel;
            wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the
            children of Men before the Dark Years. But I do not know what has happened here of late,
            nor in what mind the Rohirrim may now be between the traitor Saruman and the threat of
            Sauron. They have long been the friends of the people of Gondor, though they are not
            akin to them. It was in forgotten years long ago that Eorl the Young brought them out of
            the North, and their kinship is rather with the Bardings of Dale, and with the Beornings
            of the Wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the Riders of
            Rohan. At least they will not love the Orcs.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But Gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor ' </quote>said
        Gimli.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I believe it no more than did Boromir,' </quote>answered Aragorn.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You will soon learn the truth,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'Already they
            approach.'</quote></p>
    <p> At length even Gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. The horsemen, following
        the trail, had turned from the river, and were drawing near the downs. They were riding like
        the wind.</p>
    <p> Now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. Suddenly they swept up
        with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman swerved, passing by the foot of the
        hill, and leading the host back southward along the western skirts of the downs. After him
        they rode: a long line of mail-clad men. swift, shining, fell and fair to look upon.</p>
    <p> Their horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed; their grey coats glistened,
        their long tails flowed in the wind, their manes were braided on their proud necks. The Men
        that rode them matched them well: tall and long-limbed; their hair, flaxen-pale, flowed
        under their light helms, and streamed in long braids behind them; their faces were stern and
        keen. In their hands were tall spears of ash, painted shields were slung at their backs,
        long swords were at their belts, their burnished skirts of mail hung down upon their
        knees.</p>
    <p> In pairs they galloped by, and though every now and then one rose in his stirrups and gazed
        ahead and to either side, they appeared not to perceive the three strangers sitting silently
        and watching them. The host had almost passed when suddenly Aragorn stood up, and called in
        a loud voice:</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'What news from the North, Riders of Rohan?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> With astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging
        round. Soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen moving in a running
        circle, up the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them, and drawing ever
        inwards. Aragorn stood silent, and the other two sat without moving, wondering what way
        things would turn.</p>
    <p> Without a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears were pointed towards
        the strangers; and some of the horsemen had bows in hand, and their arrows were already
        fitted to the string. Then one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his
        helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed. He advanced until the point of his spear was
        within a foot of Aragorn's breast. Aragorn did not stir.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Who are you, and what are you doing in this land?' </quote>said the Rider, using
        the Common Speech of the West, in manner and tone like to the speech of Boromir, Man of
        Gondor.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I am called Strider,' </quote>answered Aragorn.<quote> 'I came out of the North. I
            am hunting Orcs.'</quote></p>
    <p> The Rider leaped from his horse. Giving his spear to another who rode up and dismounted at
        his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with Aragorn, surveying him keenly, and
        not without wonder. At length he spoke again.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'At first I thought that you yourselves were Orcs,' </quote>he said;<quote> 'but now
            I see that it is not so. Indeed you know little of Orcs, if you go hunting them in this
            fashion. They were swift and well-armed, and they were many. You would have changed from
            hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them. But there is something strange about
            you, Strider.' </quote>He bent his clear bright eyes again upon the Ranger.<quote> 'That
            is no name for a Man that you give. And strange too is your raiment. Have you sprung out
            of the grass? How did you escape our sight? Are you elvish folk?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'One only of us is an Elf, Legolas from the
            Woodland Realm in distant Mirkwood. But we have passed through Lothl�rien, and the gifts
            and favour of the Lady go with us.'</quote></p>
    <p> The Rider looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes hardened.<quote> 'Then there is a
            Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales tell!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Few escape her
            nets, they say. These are strange days! But if you have her favour, then you also are
            net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.' </quote>He turned a cold glance suddenly upon Legolas
        and Gimli.<quote> 'Why do you not speak, silent ones?' </quote>he demanded.</p>
    <p> Gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand gripped the handle of his axe, and
        his dark eyes flashed.<quote> 'Give me your name, horse-master, and I will give you mine,
            and more besides,' </quote>he said.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'As for that,' </quote>said the Rider, staring down at the Dwarf,<quote> 'the
            stranger should declare himself first. Yet I am named �omer son of �omund, and am called
            the Third Marshal of Riddermark.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then �omer son of �omund, Third Marshal of Riddermark, let Gimli the Dwarf Gl�in's
            son warn you against foolish words. You speak evil of that which is fair beyond the
            reach of your thought, and only little wit can excuse you.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> �omer's eyes blazed, and the Men of Rohan murmured angrily, and closed in, advancing their
            spears.<quote> 'I would cut off your head, beard and all, Master Dwarf, if it stood but
            a little higher from the ground ' </quote>said �omer.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'He stands not alone,' </quote>said Legolas, bending his bow and fitting an arrow
        with hands that moved quicker than sight.<quote> 'You would die before your stroke
            fell.'</quote></p>
    <p> �omer raised his sword, and things might have gone ill, but Aragorn sprang between them, and
        raised his hand.<quote> 'Your pardon, �omer!' </quote>he cried.<quote> 'When you know more
            you will understand why you have angered my companions. We intend no evil to Rohan, nor
            to any of its folk, neither to man nor to horse. Will you not hear our tale before you
            strike?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will,' </quote>said �omer lowering his blade.<quote> 'But wanderers in the
            Riddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt. First tell me your
            right name.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'First tell me whom you serve,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'Are you friend or foe
            of Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I serve only the Lord of the Mark, Th�oden King son of Thengel,' </quote>answered
            �omer.<quote> 'We do not serve the Power of the Black Land far away, but neither are we
            yet at open war with him; and if you are fleeing from him, then you had best leave this
            land. There is trouble now on all our borders, and we are threatened; but we desire only
            to be free, and to live as we have lived, keeping our own, and serving no foreign lord,
            good or evil. We welcomed guests kindly in the better days, but in these times the
            unbidden stranger finds us swift and hard. Come! Who are you? Whom do _you_ serve? At
            whose command do you hunt Orcs in our land?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I serve no man,' </quote>said Aragorn;<quote> 'but the servants of Sauron I pursue
            into whatever land they may go. There are few among mortal Men who know more of Orcs;
            and I do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. The Orcs whom we pursued took
            captive two of my friends. In such need a man that has no horse will go on foot, and he
            will not ask for leave to follow the trail. Nor will he count the heads of the enemy
            save with a sword. I am not weaponless.'</quote></p>
    <p> Aragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the bright
        blade of And�ril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out.<quote> 'Elendil!' </quote>he
            cried.<quote> 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn and am called Elessar, the Elfstone,
            D�nadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor. Here is the Sword that was Broken
            and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!'</quote></p>
    <p> Gimli and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this
        mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while �omer had shrunk; and in his living
        face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment
        it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a
        shining crown.</p>
    <p> �omer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down his proud eyes.<quote>
            'These are indeed strange days,' </quote>he muttered. 'Dreams and legends spring to life
        out of the grass.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Tell me, lord,' </quote>he said,<quote> 'what brings you here? And what was the
            meaning of the dark words? Long has Boromir son of Denethor been gone seeking an answer,
            and the horse that we lent him came back riderless. What doom do you bring out of the
            North?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The doom of choice,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'You may say this to Th�oden son
            of Thengel: open war lies before him, with Sauron or against him. None may live now as
            they have lived, and few shall keep what they call their own. But of these great matters
            we will speak later. If chance allows, I will come myself to the king. Now I am in great
            need, and I ask for help, or at least for tidings. You heard that we are pursuing an
            orc-host that carried off our friends. What can you tell us?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That you need not pursue them further,' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'The Orcs are
            destroyed.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And our friends?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We found none but Orcs.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But that is strange indeed,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'Did you search the
            slain? Were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? They would be small. Only
            children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There were no dwarves nor children,' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'We counted all the
            slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as is our
            custom. The ashes are smoking still.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We do not speak of dwarves or children,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Our friends
            were hobbits.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Hobbits?' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'And what may they be? It is a strange
            name.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'A strange name for a strange folk,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'But these were very
            dear to us. It seems that you have heard in Rohan of the words that troubled Minas
            Tirith. They spoke of the Halfling. These hobbits are Halflings.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Halflings!' </quote>laughed the Rider that stood beside �omer.<quote> 'Halflings!
            But they are only a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the North. Do
            we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'A man may do both,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'For not we but those who come
            after will make the legends of our time. The green earth, say you? That is a mighty
            matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Time is pressing,' </quote>said the Rider, not heeding Aragorn.<quote> 'We must
            hasten south, lord. Let us leave these wild folk to their fancies. Or let us bind them
            and take them to the king.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Peace, �othain!' </quote>said �omer in his own tongue.<quote> 'Leave me a while.
            Tell the _�ored_ to assemble on the path' </quote>and make ready to ride to the
        Entwade.'</p>

    <p> Muttering �othain retired, and spoke to the others. Soon they drew off and left �omer alone
        with the three companions.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'All that you say is strange, Aragorn.' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Yet you speak the
            truth, that is plain: the Men of the Mark do not lie, and therefore they are not easily
            deceived. But you have not told all. Will you not now speak more fully of your errand,
            so that I may judge what to do?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I set out from Imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,'
        </quote>answered Aragorn.<quote> 'With me went Boromir of Minas Tirith. My errand was to go
            to that city with the son of Denethor, to aid his folk in their war against Sauron. But
            the Company that I journeyed with had other business. Of that I cannot speak now.
            Gandalf the Grey was our leader.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Gandalf!' </quote>�omer exclaimed. 'Gandalf Greyhame is known in the Mark: but his
        name, I warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour. He has been a guest in the
        land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, after a season, or after many
        years. He is ever the herald of strange events: a bringer of evil, some now say.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss. At that time
            our trouble with Saruman began. Until then we counted Saruman our friend, hut Gandalf
            came then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in Isengard. He said that he
            himself had been a prisoner in Orthanc and had hardly escaped, and he begged for help.
            But Th�oden would not listen to him, and he went away. Speak not the name of Gandalf
            loudly in Th�oden's ears! He is wroth. For Gandalf took the horse that is called
            Shadowfax, the most precious of all the king's steeds, chief of the _Mearas_, which only
            the Lord of the Mark may ride. For the sire of their race was the great horse of Eorl
            that knew the speech of Men. Seven nights ago Shadowfax returned; but the king's anger
            is not less, for now the horse is wild and will let no man handle him.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then Shadowfax has found his way alone from the far North,' </quote>said
            Aragorn;<quote> 'for it was there that he and Gandalf parted. But alas! Gandalf will
            ride no longer. He fell into darkness in the Mines of Moria and comes not
            again.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is heavy tidings,' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'At least to me, and to many;
            though not to all, as you may find, if you come to the king.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand, though it may
            touch them sorely ere the year is much older,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'But when
            the great fall, the less must lead. My part it has been to guide our Company on the long
            road from Moria. Through L�rien we came � of which it were well that you should learn
            the truth ere you speak of it again � and thence down the leagues of the Great River to
            the falls of Rauros. There Boromir was slain by the same Orcs whom you
            destroyed.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Your news is all of woe!' </quote>cried �omer in dismay.<quote> 'Great harm is this
            death to Minas Tirith, and to us all. That was a worthy man! All spoke his praise. He
            came seldom to the Mark, for he was ever in the wars on the East-borders; but I have
            seen him. More like to the swift sons of Eorl than to the grave Men of Gondor he seemed
            to me, and likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came. But we have
            had no word of this grief out of Gondor. When did he fall?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is now the fourth day since he was slain,' </quote>answered Aragorn,<quote> 'and
            since the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of Tol
        Brandir.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'On foot?' </quote>cried �omer.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, even as you see us.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> Wide wonder came into �omer's eyes.<quote> 'Strider is too poor a name, son of Arathorn,'
        </quote>he said. 'Wingfoot I name you. This deed of the three friends should be sung in many
        a hall. Forty leagues and five you have measured ere the fourth day is ended! Hardy is the
        race of Elendil!</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But now, lord, what would you have me do! I must return in haste to Th�oden. I
            spoke warily before my men. It is true that we are not yet at open war with the Black
            Land, and there are some, close to the king's ear, that speak craven counsels; but war
            is coming. We shall not forsake our old alliance with Gondor, and while they fight we
            shall aid them: so say I and all who hold with me. The East-mark is my charge. the ward
            of the Third Marshal, and I have removed all our herds and herdfolk, withdrawing them
            beyond Entwash, and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then you do not pay tribute to Sauron?' </quote>said Gimli.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We do not and we never have.' </quote>said �omer with a flash of his eyes; 'though
        it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. Some years ago the Lord of the Black Land
        wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but we refused him. for he puts beasts to
        evil use. Then he sent plundering Orcs, and they carry off what they can, choosing always
        the black horses: few of these are now left. For that reason our feud with the Orcs is
        bitter.</p>
    <p> 'But at this time our chief concern is with Saruman. He has claimed lordship over all this
        land, and there has been war between us for many months. He has taken Orcs into his service,
        and Wolf-riders, and evil Men, and he has closed the Gap against us, so that we are likely
        to be beset both east and west.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and dwimmer-crafty,
            having many guises. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man hooded and cloaked,
            very like to Gandalf, as many now recall. His spies slip through every net, and his
            birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky. I do not know how it will all end, and my heart
            misgives me; for it seems to me that his friends do not all dwell in Isengard. But if
            you come to the king's house, you shall see for yourself. Will you not come? Do I hope
            in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need?'</quote>

        <quote> 'I will come when I may,' </quote>said Aragorn.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Come now!' </quote>said �omer. 'The Heir of Elendil would be a strength indeed to
        the Sons of Eorl in this evil tide. There is battle even now upon the Westemnet, and I fear
        that it may go ill for us.</p>
    <p> 'Indeed in this riding north I went without the king's leave, for in my absence his house is
        left with little guard. But scouts warned me of the orc-host coming down out of the East
        Wall three nights ago, and among them they reported that some bore the white badges of
        Saruman. So suspecting what I most fear, a league between Orthanc and the Dark Tower, I led
        forth my _�ored_, men of my own household; and we overtook the Orcs at nightfall two days
        ago, near to the borders of the Entwood. There we surrounded them, and gave battle yesterday
        at dawn. Fifteen of my men I lost, and twelve horses alas! For the Orcs were greater in
        number than we counted on. Others joined them. coming out of the East across the Great
        River: their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot. And others, too, came out of
        the forest. Great Orcs, who also bore the White Hand of Isengard: that kind is stronger and
        more fell than all others.</p>

            the Sword to do. Yes, and we could find a use for Gimli's axe and the bow of Legolas, if
            they will pardon my rash words concerning the Lady of the Wood. I spoke only as do all

            rode into the Mark! How shall a man judge what to do in such times?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'As he ever has judged,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'Good and ill have not changed
            since yesteryear; nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves : and another among
            Men. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden Wood as in his own
            house.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'True indeed,' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'But I do not doubt you, nor the deed
            which my heart would do. Yet I am not free to do all as I would. It is against our law
            to let strangers wander at will in our land, until the king himself shall give them
            leave, and more strict is the command in these days of peril. I have begged you to come
            back willingly with me, and you will not. Loth am I to begin a battle of one hundred
            against three.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I do not think your law was made for such a chance,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote>
            'Nor indeed am I a stranger; for I have been in this land before, more than once, and
            ridden with the host of the Rohirrim, though under other name and in other guise. You I
            have not seen before, for you are young, but I have spoken with �omund your father, and
            with Th�oden son of Thengel. Never in former days would any high lord of this land have
            constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine. My duty at least is clear, to go on.
            Come now, son of �omund, the choice must be made at last. Aid us, or at the worst let us
            go free. Or seek to carry out your law. If you do so there will be fewer to return to
            your war or to your king.'</quote></p>
    <p> �omer was silent for a moment, then he spoke.<quote> 'We both have need of haste,'
        </quote>he said.<quote> 'My company chafes to be away, and every hour lessens your hope.
            This is my choice. You may go; and what is more, I will lend you horses. This only I
            ask: when your quest is achieved, or is proved vain, return with the horses over the
            Entwade to Meduseld, the high house in Edoras where Th�oden now sits. Thus you shall
            prove to him that I have not misjudged. In this I place myself, and maybe my very life,
            in the keeping of your good faith. Do not fail.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will not,' </quote>said Aragorn.</p>

    <p> There was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his men, when �omer gave
        orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strangers; but only �othain dared to
        speak openly.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It may be well enough for this lord of the race of Gondor, as he claims,'
        </quote>he said,<quote> 'but who has heard of a horse of the Mark being given to a
            Dwarf?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No one,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'And do not trouble: no one will ever hear of
            it. I would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or
            begrudged.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' </quote>said Aragorn.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Come, you shall sit behind me, friend Gimli, said Legolas. Then all will be well,
            and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> A great dark-grey horse was brought to Aragorn, and he mounted it.<quote> 'Hasufel is his
            name,' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'May he bear you well and to better fortune than
            G�rulf, his late master!'</quote></p>
    <p> A smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to Legolas. Arod was his
        name. But Legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein.<quote> 'I need them not,'
        </quote>he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder Arod was tame and willing
        beneath him, moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the elvish way with all
        good beasts. Gimli was lifted up behind his friend. and he clung to him, not much more at
        ease than Sam Gamgee in a boat.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Farewell, and may you find what you seek!' </quote>cried �omer.<quote> 'Return with
            what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will come,' </quote>said Aragorn.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And I will come, too,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'The matter of the Lady Galadriel
            lies still between us. I have yet to teach you gentle speech. '</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We shall see,' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'So many strange things have chanced that
            to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a Dwarf's axe will seem
            no great wonder. Farewell!'</quote></p>
    <p> With that they parted. Very swift were the horses of Rohan. When after a little Gimli looked
        back, the company of �omer were already small and far away. Aragorn did not look back: he
        was watching the trail as they sped on their way, bending low with his head beside the neck
        of Hasufel. Before long they came to the borders of the Entwash, and there they met the
        other trail of which �omer had spoken, coming down from the East out of the Wold.</p>
    <p> Aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back into the saddle, he rode away
        for some distance eastward, keeping to one side and taking care not to override the
        footprints. Then he again dismounted and examined the ground, going backwards and forwards
        on foot.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There is little to discover,' </quote>he said when he returned.<quote> 'The main
            trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back; their outward
            course must have lain nearer the river. But this eastward trail is fresh and clear.
            There is no sign there of any feet going the other way, back towards Anduin. Now we must
            ride slower, and make sure that no trace or footstep branches off on either side. The
            Orcs must have been aware from this point that they were pursued; they may have made
            some attempt to get their captives away before they were overtaken.'</quote></p>
    <p> As they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over the Wold. A mist
        shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of Fangorn loomed, slowly darkling as the
        sun went west. They saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they
        passed single Orcs, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrows sticking
        in back or throat.</p>
    <p> At last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open
        glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still
        hot and smoking. Beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken
        swords, bows and darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a great
        goblin head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. Further away, not
        far from the river, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a
        mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were
        planted fifteen spears.</p>
    <p> Aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle, but the light
        faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. By nightfall they had discovered no trace
        of Merry and Pippin.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We can do no more,' </quote>said Gimli sadly.<quote> 'We have been set many riddles
            since we came to Tol Brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. I would guess that the
            burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the Orcs'.</quote> It will be hard news
        for Frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in Rivendell.
        Elrond was against their coming.'</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But Gandalf was not,' </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost '
        </quote>answered Gimli.<quote> 'His foresight failed him.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or
            for others,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'There are some things that it is better to
            begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark. But I shall not depart from this
            place yet. In any case we must here await the morning-light.'</quote></p>
    <p> A little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a spreading tree: it looked
        like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of a former year, like dry
        hands with long splayed fingers; they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze.</p>
    <p> Gimli shivered. They had brought only one blanket apiece.<quote> 'Let us light a fire,'
        </quote>he said.<quote> 'I care no longer for the danger. Let the Orcs come as thick as
            summer-moths round a candle!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'If those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them hither,'
        </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And it might draw other things, neither Orc nor Hobbit,' </quote>said
            Aragorn.<quote> 'We are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor Saruman. Also we are
            on the very edge of Fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it is
            said.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But the Rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,' </quote>said Gimli,<quote>
            'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. Yet they passed the night after
            safely here, when their labour was ended.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'They were many,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'and they do not heed the wrath of
            Fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the trees. But our paths
            are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. So have a care! Cut no living
            wood!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There is no need,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'The Riders have left chip and bough
            enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.' </quote>He went off to gather fuel, and
        busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but Aragorn sat silent with his back to
        the great tree, deep in thought; and Legolas stood alone in the open, looking towards the
        profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, as one who listens to voices calling from a
        distance.</p>
    <p> When the Dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions drew close to it and sat
        together, shrouding the light with their hooded forms. Legolas looked up at the boughs of
        the tree reaching out above them.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Look!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'The tree is glad of the fire!'</quote></p>
    <p> It may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes, but certainly to each of the
        companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so as to come above the
        flames, while the upper branches were stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff,
        and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth.</p>
    <p> There was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near at hand, made itself
        felt as a great brooding presence, full of secret purpose. After a while Legolas spoke
        again.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Celeborn warned us not to go far into Fangorn,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Do you
            know why, Aragorn? What are the fables of the forest that Boromir had
        heard?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I have heard many tales in Gondor and elsewhere,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'but
            if it were not for the words of Celeborn I should deem them only fables that Men have
            made as true knowledge fades. I had thought of asking you what was the truth of the
            matter. And if an Elf of the Wood does not know, how shall a Man answer?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You have journeyed further than I,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'I have heard
            nothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell how the Onodrim, that Men call
            Ents, dwelt there long ago; for Fangorn is old, old even as the Elves would reckon
            it.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, it is old,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'as old as the forest by the
            Barrow-downs, and it is far greater. Elrond says that the two are akin, the last
            strongholds of the mighty woods of the Elder Days, in which the Firstborn roamed while
            Men still slept. Yet Fangorn holds some secret of its own. What it is I do not
            know.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And I do not wish to know,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Let nothing that dwells in
            Fangorn be troubled on my account!'</quote></p>
    <p> They now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch fell to Gimli. The
        others lay down. Almost at once sleep laid hold on them.<quote> 'Gimli!' </quote>said
        Aragorn drowsily.<quote> 'Remember, it is perilous to cut bough or twig from a living tree
            in Fangorn. But do not stray far in search of dead wood. Let the fire die rather! Call
            me at need!'</quote></p>
    <p> With that he fell asleep. Legolas already lay motionless, his fair hands folded upon his
        breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and deep dream, as is the way with Elves.
        Gimli sat hunched by the fire, running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. The
        tree rustled. There was no other sound.</p>
    <p> Suddenly Gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood an old bent
        man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his wide-brimmed hat was pulled down
        over his eyes. Gimli sprang up, too amazed for the moment to cry out, though at once the
        thought flashed into his mind that Saruman had caught them. Both Aragorn and Legolas, roused
        by his sudden movement, sat up and stared. The old man did not speak or make, sign.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, father, what can we do for you?' </quote>said Aragorn, leaping to his
            feet.<quote> 'Come and be warm, if you are cold!' </quote>He strode forward, but the old
        man was gone. There was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they did not dare to
        wander far. The moon had set and the night was very dark.</p>
    <p> Suddenly Legolas gave a cry.<quote> 'The horses! The horses!'</quote></p>
    <p> The horses were gone. They had dragged their pickets and disappeared. For me time the three
        companions stood still and silent, troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune. They were
        under the eaves of Fangorn, and endless leagues lay between them and the Men of Rohan, their
        only friends in this wide and dangerous land. As they stood, it seemed to them that they
        heard, far off in the night. the sound of horses whinnying and neighing. Then all was quiet
        again, except for the cold rustle of the wind.</p>

    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, they are gone,' </quote>said Aragorn at last.<quote> 'We cannot find them or
            catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do without. We
            started on our feet, and we have those still.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Feet!' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'But we cannot eat them as well as walk on them '
        </quote>He threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of Rohan,'
        </quote>laughed Legolas.<quote> 'You will make a rider yet.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance,' </quote>said Gimli.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'If you wish to know what I think,' </quote>he began again after a while<quote> 'I
            think it was Saruman. Who else? Remember the words of �omer: he walks about like an old
            man hooded and cloaked. Those were the words. He has gone off with our horses, or scared
            them away, and here we are. There is more trouble coming to us, mark my
        words!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I mark them,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'But I marked also that this old man had
            a hat not a hood. Still I do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are in peril
            here, by night or day. Yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest,
            while we may. I will watch for a while now, Gimli. I have more need of thought than of
            sleep.'</quote></p>
    <p> The night passed slowly. Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli followed Legolas, and their
        watches wore away. But nothing happened. The old man did not appear again, and the horses
        did not return.</p>


    <chapter>_Chapter 3_</chapter>
    <p> The Uruk-Hai</p>

    <p> Pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own small voice
        echoing in black tunnels, calling _Frodo, Frodo!_ But instead of Frodo hundreds of hideous
        orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from
        every side. Where was Merry?</p>
    <p> He woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back. Evening was coming and the sky
        above was growing dim. He turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking.
        His wrists, legs, and ankles were tied with cords. Beside him Merry lay, white-faced, with a
        dirty rag bound across his brows. All about them sat or stood a great company of Orcs.</p>
    <p> Slowly in Pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from
        dream-shadows. Of course: he and Merry had run off into the woods. What had come over them?
        Why had they dashed off like that, taking no notice of old Strider? They had run a long way
        shouting�he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right
        into a group of Orcs: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to see Merry and
        Pippin until they were almost in their arms. Then they yelled and dozens of other goblins
        had sprung out of the trees. Merry and he had drawn their swords, but the Orcs did not wish
        to fight, and had tried only to lay hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several of
        their arms and hands. Good old Merry!</p>
    <p> Then Boromir had come leaping through the trees. He had made them fight. He slew many of
        them and the rest fled. But they had not gone far on the way back when they were attacked
        again. by a hundred Orcs at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows:
        always at Boromir. Boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at first the
        Orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had
        attacked more fierce than ever. Pippin did not remember much more. His last memo was of
        Boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I suppose I was knocked on the head,' </quote>he said to himself.<quote> 'I wonder
            if poor Merry is much hurt. What has happened to Boromir? Why didn't the Orcs kill us?
            Where are we, and where are we going?'</quote></p>
    <p> He could not answer the questions. He felt cold and sick.<quote> 'I wish Gandalf had never
            persuaded Elrond to let us come,' </quote>he thought.<quote> 'What good have I been?
            Just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. And now I have been stolen and I am
            just a piece of luggage for the Orcs. I hope Strider or someone will come and claim us!
            But ought I to hope for it? Won't that throw out all the plans? I wish I could get
            free!'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> He struggled a little, quite uselessly. One of the Orcs sitting near laughed and said
        something to a companion in their abominable tongue.<quote> 'Rest while you can, little
            fool!' </quote>he said then to Pippin, in the Common Speech, which he made almost as
        hideous as his own language.<quote> 'Rest while you can! We'll find a use for your legs
            before long. You'll wish you had got none before we get home.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'If I had my way, you'd wish you were dead now,' </quote>said the other.<quote> 'I'd
            make you squeak, you miserable rat.' </quote>He stooped over Pippin bringing his yellow
        fangs close to his face. He had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand.<quote>
            'Lie quiet, or I'll tickle you with this,' </quote>he hissed.<quote> 'Don't draw
            attention to yourself, or I may forget my orders. Curse the Isengarders! _Ugl�k u
            bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob b�bhosh skai':</quote>_ he passed into a long angry
        speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling.</p>
    <p> Terrified Pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and ankles was growing, and the
        stones beneath him were boring into his back. To take his mind off himself he listened
        intently to all that he could hear. There were many voices round about, and though
        orc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like
        a quarrel had begun, and was getting hotter.</p>
    <p> To Pippin's surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible many of the Orcs were
        using ordinary language. Apparently the members of two or three quite different tribes were
        present, and they could not understand one another's orc-speech. There was an angry debate
        concerning what they were to do now: which way they were to take and what should be done
        with the prisoners.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There's no time to kill them properly,' </quote>said one.<quote> 'No time for play
            on this trip.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That can't be helped,' </quote>said another.<quote> 'But why not kill them quick,
            kill them now? They're a cursed nuisance, and we're in a hurry. Evening's coming on, and

    <p>
        <quote> 'Orders.' </quote>said a third voice in a deep growl. _'Kill all but_NOT_ the
        Halfings; they are to be brought back_ALIVE_ as quickly as possible_. That's my orders.'</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'What are they wanted for?' </quote>asked several voices.<quote> 'Why alive? Do they
            give good sport?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No! I heard that one of them has got something, something that's wanted for the

    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Is that all you know? Why don't we search them and find out? We might find
            something that we could use ourselves.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is a very interesting remark,' </quote>sneered a voice, softer than the others
        but more evil.<quote> 'I may have to report that. The prisoners are NOT to be searched or
            plundered: those are _my_ orders.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And mine too,' </quote>said the deep voice.<quote> '_Alive and as captured; no
            spoiling_. That's my orders.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Not our orders!' </quote>said one of the earlier voices.<quote> 'We have come all
            the way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go back
            north.'</quote></p>

        <quote> 'Then you can wish again,' </quote>said the growling voice.<quote> 'I am Ugl�k. I

        <quote> 'If we could cross the Great River, we might,' </quote>said another voice.<quote>
            'But there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges.'</quote></p>

        <quote> 'I came across,' </quote>said the evil voice.<quote> 'A winged Nazg�l awaits us

        <quote> 'Maybe, maybe! Then you'll fly off with our prisoners, and get all the pay and

    <p>
        <quote> 'Aye, we must stick together,' </quote>growled Ugl�k.<quote> 'I don't trust you

    <p>
        <quote> 'You have spoken more than enough, Ugl�k,' </quote>sneered the evil voice. 'I wonder
        how they would like it in Lugb�rz. They might think that Ugl�k's shoulders needed relieving
        of a swollen head. They might ask where his strange ideas came from. Did they come from
        Saruman, perhaps? Who does _he_ think he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white
        badges? They might agree with me, with Grishn�kh their trusted messenger; and I Grishn�kh
        say this: Saruman is a fool. and a dirty treacherous fool. But the Great Eye is on him.</p>

        <quote> '_Swine_ is it? How do you folk like being called _swine_ by the muck-rakers of a

    </p>
    <p> Many loud yells in orc-speech answered him, and the ringing clash of weapons being drawn.
        Cautiously Pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would happen. His guards had gone to join
        in the fray. In the twilight he saw a large black Orc, probably Ugl�k, standing facing
        Grishn�kh, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to
        the ground. Round them were many smaller goblins. Pippin supposed that these were the ones
        from the North. They had drawn their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack Ugl�k.</p>
    <p> Ugl�k shouted, and a number of other Orcs of nearly his own size ran up. Then suddenly,
        without warning, Ugl�k sprang forwards, and with two swift strokes swept the heads off two
        of his opponents. Grishn�kh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. The others gave
        way, and one stepped backwards and fell over Merry's prostrate form with a curse. Yet that
        probably saved his life, for Ugl�k's followers leaped over him and cut down another with
        their broad-bladed swords. It was the yellow-fanged guard. His body fell right on top of
        Pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Put up your weapons!' </quote>shouted Ugl�k.<quote> 'And let's have no more
            nonsense! We go straight west from here, and down the stair. From there straight to the
            downs, then along the river to the forest. And we march day and night. That
            clear?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now,' </quote>thought Pippin,<quote> 'if only it takes that ugly fellow a little
            while to get his troop under control, I've got a chance.' </quote>A gleam of hope had
        come to him. The edge of the black knife had snicked his arm, and then slid down to his
        wrist. He felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he also felt the cold touch of steel
        against his skin.</p>
    <p> The Orcs were getting ready to march again, but some of the Northerners were still
        unwilling, and the Isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed. There was much
        cursing and confusion. For the moment Pippin was unwatched. His legs were securely bound,
        but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and his hands were in front of him. He could
        move them both together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead Orc to one
        side, then hardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up and down against
        the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held it fast. The cord was cut!
        Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two
        loops and slipped it over his hands. Then he lay very still.</p>

    <p>
        <quote> 'Pick up those prisoners!' </quote>shouted Ugl�k.<quote> 'Don't play any tricks with
            them! If they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.'</quote></p>
    <p> An Orc seized Pippin like a sack. put its head between his tied hands, grabbed his arms and
        dragged them down, until Pippin's face was crushed against its neck; then it jolted off with
        him. Another treated Merry in the same way. The Orc's clawlike hand gripped Pippin's arms
        like iron; the nails bit into him. He shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams.</p>
    <p> Suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was early night, but the slim moon
        was already falling westward. They were on the edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over
        a sea of pale mist. There was a sound of water falling nearby.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The scouts have come back at last,' </quote>said an Orc close at hand.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, what did you discover?' </quote>growled the voice of Ugl�k.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Only a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All's clear now.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now, I daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have shot him. He'll raise the
            alarm. The cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning. Now we'll have to leg it
            double quick.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> A shadow bent over Pippin. It was Ugl�k.<quote> 'Sit up!' </quote>said the Orc.<quote> 'My
            lads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down and you must use your
            legs. Be helpful now. No crying out, no trying to escape. We have ways of paying for
            tricks that you won't like, though they won't spoil your usefulness for the
            Master.'</quote></p>
    <p> He cut the thongs round Pippin's legs and ankles, picked him up by his hair and stood him on
        his feet. Pippin fell down, and Ugl�k dragged him up by his hair again. Several Orcs
        laughed. Ugl�k thrust a flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his
        throat: he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. The pain in his legs and ankles
        vanished. He could stand.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now for the other!' </quote>said Ugl�k. Pippin saw him go to Merry, who was lying
        close by, and kick him. Merry groaned. Seizing him roughly Ugl�k pulled him into a sitting
        position, and tore the bandage off his head. Then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff
        out of a small wooden box. Merry cried out and struggled wildly.</p>
    <p> The Orcs clapped and hooted.<quote> 'Can't take his medicine,' </quote>they jeered.<quote>
            'Doesn't know what's good for him. Ai! We shall have some fun later.'</quote></p>
    <p> But at the moment Ugl�k was not engaged in sport. He needed speed and had to humour
        unwilling followers. He was healing Merry in orc-fashion; and his treatment worked swiftly.
        When he had forced a drink from his flask down the hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and
        dragged him to his feet, Merry stood up, looking pale but grim and defiant, and very much
        alive. The gash in his forehead gave him no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the
        end of his days.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Hullo, Pippin!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'So you've come on this little expedition,
            too? Where do we get bed and breakfast?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now then!' </quote>said Ugl�k.<quote> 'None of that! Hold your tongues. No talk to
            one another. Any trouble will be reported at the other end, and He'll know how to pay
            you. You'll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can stomach.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> The orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the misty plain below. Merry
        and Pippin, separated by a dozen Orcs or more, climbed down with them. At the bottom they
        stepped on to grass, and the hearts of the hobbits rose.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now straight on!' </quote>shouted Ugl�k.<quote> 'West and a little north. Follow
            Lugdush.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But what are we going to do at sunrise?' </quote>said some of the Northerners.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Go on running,' </quote>said Ugl�k.<quote> 'What do you think? Sit on the grass and
            wait for the Whiteskins to join the picnic?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But we can't run in the sunlight.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You'll run with me behind you,' </quote>said Ugl�k.<quote> 'Run! Or you'll never
            see your beloved holes again. By the White Hand! What's the use of sending out
            mountain-maggots on a trip, only half trained. Run, curse you! Run while night
            lasts!'</quote></p>
    <p> Then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of Orcs. They kept no
        order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed was very great. Each hobbit had a
        guard of three. Pippin was far back in the line. He wondered how long he would be able to go
        on at this pace: he had had no food since the morning. One of his guards had a whip. But at
        present the orc-liquor was still hot in him. His wits, too, were wide-awake.</p>
    <p> Every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the keen face of Strider
        bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind. But what could even a Ranger see
        except a confused trail of orc-feet? His own little prints and Merry's were overwhelmed by
        the trampling of the iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them.</p>
    <p> They had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow
        depression, where the ground was soft and wet. Mist lay there, pale-glimmering in the last
        rays of the sickle moon. The dark shapes of the Orcs in front grew dim, and then were
        swallowed up.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Ai! Steady now!' </quote>shouted Ugl�k from the rear.</p>
    <p> A sudden thought leaped into Pippin's mind, and he acted on it at once. He swerved aside to
        the right, and dived out of the reach of his clutching guard, headfirst into the mist; he
        landed sprawling on the grass.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Halt!' </quote>yelled Ugl�k.</p>
    <p> There was for a moment turmoil and confusion. Pippin sprang up and ran. But the Orcs were
        after him. Some suddenly loomed up right in front of him.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No hope of escape!' </quote>thought Pippin.<quote> 'But there is a hope that I have
            left some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground.' </quote>He groped with his two
        tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the brooch of his cloak. Just as long arms and hard
        claws seized him. he let it fall.<quote> 'There I suppose it will lie until the end of
            time,' </quote>he thought.<quote> 'I don't know why I did it. If the others have
            escaped, they've probably all gone with Frodo.'</quote></p>
    <p> A whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Enough!' </quote>shouted Ugl�k running up.<quote> 'He's still got to run a long way
            yet. Make 'em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But that's not all,' </quote>he snarled, turning to Pippin.<quote> 'I shan't
            forget. Payment is only put off. Leg it!'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> Neither Pippin nor Merry remembered much of the later part of the journey. Evil dreams and
        evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery, with hope growing ever fainter
        behind. They ran, and they ran, striving to keep up the pace set by the Orcs, licked every
        now and again with a cruel thong cunningly handled. If they halted or stumbled, they were
        seized and dragged for some distance.</p>
    <p> The warmth of the orc-draught had gone. Pippin felt cold and sick again. Suddenly he fell
        face downward on the turf. Hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him. He was
        carried like a sack once more, and darkness grew about him: whether the darkness of another
        night, or a blindness of his eyes, he could not tell.</p>
    <p> Dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that many of the Orcs were demanding a
        halt. Ugl�k was shouting. He felt himself flung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, till
        black dreams took him. But he did not long escape from pain; soon the iron grip of merciless
        hands was on him again. For a long time he was tossed and shaken, and then slowly the
        darkness gave way, and he came back to the waking world and found that it was morning.
        Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.</p>
    <p> There he lay for a while, fighting with despair. His head swam, but from the heat in his
        body he guessed that he had been given another draught. An Orc stooped over him, and flung
        him some bread and a strip of raw dried flesh. He ate the stale grey bread hungrily, but not
        the meat. He was famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an Orc,
        the flesh of he dared not guess what creature.</p>
    <p> He sat up and looked about. Merry was not far away. They were by the banks of a swift narrow
        river. Ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun. A dark
        smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them.</p>
    <p> There was much shouting and debating among the Orcs; a quarrel seemed on the point of
        breaking out again between the Northerners and the Isengarders. Some were pointing back away
        south, and some were pointing eastward.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Very well,' </quote>said Ugl�k.<quote> 'Leave them to me then! No killing, as I've
            told you before; but if you want to throw away what we've come all the way to get, throw
            it away! I'll look after it. Let the fighting Uruk-hai do the work, as usual. If you're
            afraid of the Whiteskins, run! Run! There's the forest,' </quote>he shouted, pointing
            ahead.<quote> 'Get to it! It's your best hope. Off you go! And quick, before I knock a
            few more heads off, to put some sense into the others.'</quote></p>
    <p> There was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the Northerners broke away and dashed
        off, over a hundred of them, running wildly along the river towards the mountains. The
        hobbits were left with the Isengarders: a grim dark band, four score at least of large,
        swart, slant-eyed Orcs with great bows and short broad-bladed swords. A few of the larger
        and bolder Northerners remained with them.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now we'll deal with Grishn�kh,' </quote>said Ugl�k; but some even of his own
        followers were looking uneasily southwards.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I know,' </quote>growled Ugl�k.<quote> 'The cursed horse-boys have got wind of us.
            But that's all your fault, Snaga. You and the other scouts ought to have your ears cut
            off. But we are the fighters. We'll feast on horseflesh yet, or something
            better.'</quote></p>
    <p> At that moment Pippin saw why some of the troop had been pointing eastward. From that
        direction there now came hoarse cries, and there was Grishn�kh again, and at his back a
        couple of score of others like him: long-armed crook-legged Orcs. They had a red eye painted
        on their shields. Ugl�k stepped forward to meet them.<quote> 'So you've come back?'
        </quote>he said.<quote> 'Thought better of it, eh?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I've returned to see that Orders are carried out and the prisoners safe,'
        </quote>answered Grishn�kh.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Indeed!' </quote>said Ugl�k.<quote> 'Waste of effort. I'll see that orders are
            carried out in my command. And what else did you come back for? You went in a hurry. Did
            you leave anything behind?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I left a fool,' </quote>snarled Grishn�kh.<quote> 'But there were some stout
            fellows with him that are too good to lose. I knew you'd lead them into a mess. I've
            come to help them.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Splendid!' </quote>laughed Ugl�k.<quote> 'But unless you've got some guts for
            fighting, you've taken the wrong way. Lugb�rz was your road. The Whiteskins are coming.
            What's happened to your precious Nazg�l? Has he had another mount shot under him? Now,
            if you'd brought him along, that might have been useful-if these Nazg�l are all they
            make out.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> '_Nazg�l, Nazg�l_,' </quote>said Grishn�kh, shivering and licking his lips, as if
        the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully.<quote> 'You speak of what is deep
            beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, Ugl�k,' </quote>he said.<quote> '_Nazg�l!_Ah! All
            that they make out! One day you'll wish that you had not said that. Ape!' </quote>he
        snarled fiercely.<quote> 'You ought to know that they're the apple of the Great Eye. But the
            winged Nazg�l: not yet, not yet. He won't let them show themselves across the Great
            River yet, not too soon. They're for the War-and other purposes.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You seem to know a lot,' </quote>said Ugl�k.<quote> 'More than is good for you, I
            guess. Perhaps those in Lugb�rz might wonder how, and why. But in the meantime the
            Uruk-hai of Isengard can do the dirty work, as usual. Don't stand slavering there! Get
            your rabble together! The other swine are legging it to the forest. You'd better follow.
            You wouldn't get back to the Great River alive. Right off the mark! Now! I'll be on your
            heels.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> The Isengarders seized Merry and Pippin again and slung them on their backs. Then the troop
        started off. Hour after hour they ran, pausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to
        fresh carriers. Either because they were quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of
        Grishn�kh's, the Isengarders gradually passed through the Orcs of Mordor, and Grishn�kh's
        folk closed in behind. Soon they were gaining also on the Northerners ahead. The forest
        began to draw nearer.</p>
    <p> Pippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was grated by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of
        the Orc that held him. Immediately in front were bowed backs, and tough thick legs going up
        and down, up and down, unresting, as if they were made of wire and horn, beating out the
        nightmare seconds of an endless time.</p>
    <p> In the afternoon Ugl�k's troop overtook the Northerners. They were flagging in the rays of
        the bright sun, winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it was; their heads were down
        and their tongues lolling out.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Maggots!' </quote>jeered the Isengarders.<quote> 'You're cooked. The Whiteskins
            will catch you and eat you. They're coming!'</quote></p>
    <p> A cry from Grishn�kh showed that this was not mere jest. Horsemen, riding very swiftly, had
        indeed been sighted: still far behind, but gaining on the Orcs, gaining on them like a tide
        over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand.</p>

    <p> Minas Tirith</p>

    <p> Pippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf's cloak. He wondered if he was awake or still
        sleeping, still in the swift-moving dream in which he had been wrapped so long since the
        great ride began. The dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. He
        could see nothing but the wheeling stars, and away to his right vast shadows against the sky
        where the mountains of the South marched past. Sleepily he tried to reckon the times and
        stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy and uncertain.</p>
    <p> There had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt, and then in the dawn he had
        seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had come to the silent town and the great empty house on
        the hill. And hardly had they reached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over
        once again, and men wilted with fear. But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and he had
        slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking
        and Gandalf giving orders. And then again riding, riding in the night. This was the second,
        no, the third night since he had looked in the Stone. And with that hideous memory he woke
        fully, and shivered, and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices.</p>
    <p> A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers Pippin cowered back,
        afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful country Gandalf was bearing him. He rubbed
        his eyes, and then he saw that it was the moon rising above the eastern shadows, now almost
        at the full. So the night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on. He
        stirred and spoke.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Where are we, Gandalf?' </quote>he asked.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'In the realm of Gondor,' </quote>the wizard answered.<quote> 'The land of An�rien
            is still passing by.'</quote></p>
    <p> There was a silence again for a while. Then,<quote> 'What is that?' </quote>cried Pippin
        suddenly, clutching at Gandalf's cloak.<quote> 'Look! Fire, red fire! Are there dragons in
            this land? Look, there is another!'</quote></p>
    <p> For answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse.<quote> 'On, Shadowfax! We must hasten. Time is
            short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight, calling for aid. War is kindled. See,
            there is the fire on Amon D�n, and flame on Eilenach; and there they go speeding west:
            Nardol, Erelas, Min-Rimmon, Calenhad, and the Halifirien on the borders of
            Rohan.'</quote></p>
    <p> But Shadowfax paused in his stride, slowing to a walk, and then he lifted up his head and
        neighed. And out of the darkness the answering neigh of other horses came; and presently the
        thudding of hoofs was heard, and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the
        moon and vanished into the West. Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away,
        and the night flowed over him like a roaring wind.</p>
    <p> Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of the customs
        of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills
        along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh
        horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or to
        Belfalas in the South.<quote> 'It is long since the beacons of the North were lit,'
        </quote>he said;<quote> 'and in the ancient days of Gondor they were not needed, for they
            had the Seven Stones.' </quote>Pippin stirred uneasily.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Sleep again, and do not be afraid!' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'For you are not
            going like Frodo to Mordor, but to Minas Tirith, and there you will be as safe as you
            can be anywhere in these days. If Gondor falls, or the Ring is taken, then the Shire
            will be no refuge.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You do not comfort me,' </quote>said Pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over him.
        The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a glimpse of high white
        peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the
        westering moon. He wondered where Frodo was, and if he was already in Mordor, or if he was
        dead; and he did not know that Frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond
        Gondor ere the coming of the day.</p>

    <p> Pippin woke to the sound of voices. Another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted
        by. It was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again, and chill grey mists were about them.
        Shadowfax stood steaming with sweat, but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of
        weariness. Many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist
        loomed a wall of stone. Partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the night was passed
        the sound of hurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels, and the creak
        of wheels. Torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog. Gandalf was speaking
        to the men that barred his way, and as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was
        being discussed.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yea truly, we know you, Mithrandir,' </quote>said the leader of the men,<quote>
            'and you know the pass-words of the Seven Gates and are free to go forward. But we do
            not know your companion. What is he? A dwarf out of the mountains in the North? We wish
            for no strangers in the land at this time, unless they be mighty men of arms in whose
            faith and help we can trust.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will vouch for him before the seat of Denethor,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote>
            'And as for valour, that cannot be computed by stature. He has passed through more
            battles and perils than you have, Ingold, though you be twice his height; and he comes
            now from the storming of Isengard, of which we bear tidings, and great weariness is on
            him, or I would wake him. His name is Peregrin, a very valiant man.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Man?' </quote>said Ingold dubiously; and the others laughed.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Man!' </quote>cried Pippin, now thoroughly roused.<quote> 'Man! Indeed not! I am a
            hobbit and no more valiant than I am a man, save perhaps now and again by necessity. Do
            not let Gandalf deceive you!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Many a doer of great deeds might say no more,' </quote>said Ingold.<quote> 'But
            what is a hobbit?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'A Halfling,' </quote>answered Gandalf.<quote> 'Nay, not the one that was spoken
            of,' </quote>he added seeing the wonder in the men's faces.<quote> 'Not he, yet one of
            his kindred.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, and one who journeyed with him,' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'And Boromir of
            your City was with us, and he saved me in the snows of the North, and at the last he was
            slain defending me from many foes.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Peace!' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'The news of that grief should have been told
            first to the father.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It has been guessed already,' </quote>said Ingold;<quote> 'for there have been
            strange portents here of late. But pass on now quickly! For the Lord of Minas Tirith
            will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son, be he man
        or-'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Hobbit,' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'Little service can I offer to your lord, but
            what I can do, I would do, remembering Boromir the brave.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Fare you well!' </quote>said Ingold; and the men made way for Shadow fax, and he
        passed through a narrow gate in the wall.<quote> 'May you bring good counsel to Denethor in
            his need, and to us all, Mithrandir!' </quote>Ingold cried.<quote> 'But you come with
            tidings of grief and danger, as is your wont, they say.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Because I come seldom but when my help is needed,' </quote>answered Gandalf.<quote>
            'And as for counsel, to you I would say that you are over-late in repairing the wall of
            the Pelennor. Courage will now be your best defence against the storm that is at hand �
            that and such hope as I bring. For not all the tidings that I bring are evil. But leave
            your trowels and sharpen your swords!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The work will be finished ere evening,' </quote>said Ingold.<quote> 'This is the
            last portion of the wall to be put in defence: the least open to attack, for it looks
            towards our friends of Rohan. Do you know aught of them? Will they answer the summons,
            think you?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, they will come. But they have fought many battles at your back. This road and
            no road looks towards safety any longer. Be vigilant! But for Gandalf Stormcrow you
            would have seen a host of foes coming out of An�rien and no Riders of Rohan. And you may
            yet. Fare you well, and sleep not!'</quote>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p> Gandalf passed now into the wide land beyond the Rammas Echor. So the men of Gondor called
        the out wall that they had built with great labour, after Ithilien fell under the shadow of
        their Enemy. For ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains' feet and so back again,
        enclosing in its fence the fields of the Pelennor: fair and fertile townlands on the long
        slopes and terraces falling to the deep levels of the Anduin. At its furthest point from the
        Great Gate of the City, north-eastward, the wall was four leagues distant, and there from a
        frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the river, and men had made it high and
        strong; for at that point, upon a walled causeway, the road came in from the fords and
        bridges of Osgiliath and passed through a guarded gate between embattled towers. At its
        nearest point the wall was little more than one league from the City, and that was
        south-eastward. There Anduin, going in a wide knee about the hills of Emyn Arnen in South
        Ithilien, bent sharply west, and the out-wall rose upon its very brink; and beneath it lay
        the quays and landings of the Harlond for craft that came upstream from the southern
        fiefs.</p>
    <p> The townlands were rich, with wide tilth and many orchards, and homesteads there were with
        oast and garner, fold and byre, and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands
        down to Anduin. Yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many, and the most
        part of the people of Gondor lived in the seven circles of the City, or in the high vales of
        the mountain-borders, in Lossarnach, or further south in fair Lebennin with its five swift
        streams. There dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea. They were reckoned men
        of Gondor, yet their blood was mingled, and there were short and swarthy folk among them
        whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the
        Dark Years ere the coming of the kings. But beyond, in the great fief of Belfalas, dwelt
        Prince Imrahil in his castle of Dol Amroth by the sea, and he was of high blood, and his
        folk also, tall men and proud with sea-grey eyes.</p>
    <p> Now after Gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky, and Pippin
        roused himself and looked up. To his left lay a sea of mist, rising to a bleak shadow in the
        East; but to his right great mountains reared their heads, ranging from the West to a steep
        and sudden end, as if in the making of the land the River had burst through a great barrier,
        carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to come. And there
        where the White Mountains of Ered Nimrais came to their end he saw, as Gandalf had promised,
        the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, the deep purple shadows of its high glens, and its tall
        face whitening in the rising day. And upon its out-thrust knee was the Guarded City, with
        its seven walls of stone so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but
        carven by giants out of the bones of the earth.</p>
    <p> Even as Pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to white, blushing faintly
        in the dawn; and suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft
        that smote the face of the City. Then Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion,
        standing high within the topmost walls' shone out against the sky, glimmering like a spike
        of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it were
        wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the
        morning breeze' and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets.</p>

    <p> So Gandalf and Peregrin rode to the Great Gate of the Men of Gondor at the rising of the
        sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Mithrandir! Mithrandir!' </quote>men cried.<quote> 'Now we know that the storm is
            indeed nigh!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is upon you,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'I have ridden on its wings. Let me
            pass! I must come to your Lord Denethor, while his stewardship lasts. Whatever betide,
            you have come to the end of the Gondor that you have known. Let me pass!'</quote></p>
    <p> Then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him no further, though
        they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at the horse that bore him. For
        the people of the City used horses very little and they were seldom seen in their streets,
        save only those ridden by the errand-riders of their lord. And they said:<quote> 'Surely
            that is one of the great steeds of the King of Rohan? Maybe the Rohirrim will come soon
            to strengthen us.' </quote>But Shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road.</p>

    <p> For the fashion of Minas Tirith was such that it was built on seven levels, each delved into
        the hill, and about each was set a wall, and in each wall was a gate. But the gates were not
        set in a line: the Great Gate in the City Wall was at the east point of the circuit, but the
        next faced half south, and the third half north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the
        paved way that climbed towards the Citadel turned first this way and then that across the
        face of the hill. And each time that it passed the line of the Great Gate it went through an
        arched tunnel, piercing a vast pier of rock whose huge out-thrust bulk divided in two all
        the circles of the City save the first. For partly in the primeval shaping of the hill,
        partly by the mighty craft and labour of old, there stood up from the rear of the wide court
        behind the Gate a towering bastion of stone, its edge sharp as a ship-keel facing east. Up
        it rose, even to the level of the topmost circle, and there was crowned by a battlement; so
        that those in the Citadel might, like mariners in a mountainous ship, look from its peak
        sheer down upon the Gate seven hundred feet below. The entrance to the Citadel also looked
        eastward, but was delved in the heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit slope ran up to
        the seventh gate. Thus men reached at last the High Court, and the Place of the Fountain
        before the feet of the White Tower: tall and shapely, fifty fathoms from its base to the
        pinnacle, where the banner of the Stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain.</p>
    <p> A strong citadel it was indeed, and not to be taken by a host of enemies, if there were any
        within that could hold weapons; unless some foe could come behind and scale the lower skirts
        of Mindolluin, and so come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the Hill of Guard to the
        mountain mass. But that shoulder, which rose to the height of the fifth wall, was hedged
        with great ramparts right up to the precipice that overhung its western end; and in that
        space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords, for ever silent between
        the mountain and the tower.</p>

    <p> Pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and more splendid than
        anything that he had dreamed of; greater and stronger than Isengard, and far more beautiful.
        Yet it was in truth falling year by year into decay; and already it lacked half the men that
        could have dwelt at ease there. In every street they passed some great house or court over
        whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient shapes:
        names Pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there; and yet now they
        were silent, and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements, nor voice was heard in their
        halls, nor any face looked out from door or empty window.</p>
    <p> At last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate, and the warm sun that shone down beyond
        the river, as Frodo walked in the glades of Ithilien, glowed here on the smooth walls and
        rooted pillars, and the great arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and
        kingly head. Gandalf dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the Citadel, and Shadowfax
        suffered himself to be led away at the soft word of his master.</p>
    <p> The Guards of the gate were robed in black, and their helms were of strange shape,
        high-crowned, with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the face, and above the cheek-guards
        were set the white wings of sea-birds; but the helms gleamed with a flame of silver, for
        they were indeed wrought of _mithril_, heirlooms from the glory of old days. Upon the black
        surcoats were embroidered in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and
        many-pointed stars. This was the livery of the heirs of Elendil, and none wore it now in all
        Gondor, save the Guards of the Citadel before the Court of the Fountain where the White Tree
        once had grown.</p>

    <p> Already it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them: and at once they were
        admitted, silently, and without question. Quickly Gandalf strode across the white-paved
        court. A sweet fountain played there in the morning sun, and a sward of bright green lay
        about it; but in the midst. drooping over the pool, stood a dead tree, and the falling drops
        dripped sadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water.</p>
    <p> Pippin glanced at it as he hurried after Gandalf. It looked mournful, he thought, and he
        wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended.</p>
    <p> _Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree._</p>
    <p> The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind. And then he found himself at
        the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; and behind the wizard he passed the
        tall silent door-wardens and entered the cool echoing shadows of the house of stone.</p>
    <p> They walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went Gandalf spoke softly to
            Pippin.<quote> 'Be careful of your words, Master Peregrin! This is no time for hobbit
            pertness. Th�oden is a kindly old man. Denethor is of another sort, proud and subtle, a
            man of far greater lineage and power, though he is not called a king. But he will speak
            most to you, and question you much, since you can tell him of his son Boromir. He loved
            him greatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. But under cover
            of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from
            me. Do not tell him more than you need, and leave quiet the matter of Frodo's errand. I
            will deal with that in due time. And say nothing about Aragorn either, unless you
            must.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Why not? What is wrong with Strider?' </quote>Pippin whispered.<quote> 'He meant to
            come here, didn't he? And he'll be arriving soon himself anyway.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Maybe, maybe,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'Though if he comes, it is likely to be
            in some way that no one expects, not even Denethor. It will be better so. At least he
            should come unheralded by us.'</quote></p>
    <p> Gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal.<quote> 'See, Master Pippin, there is no
            time to instruct you now in the history of Gondor; though it might have been better, if
            you had learned something of it, when you were still birds-nesting and playing truant in
            the woods of the Shire. Do as I bid! It is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the
            death of his heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who will, if
            he comes, claim the kingship. Is that enough?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Kingship?' </quote>said Pippin amazed.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'If you have walked all these days with closed
            ears and mind asleep, wake up now!' </quote>He knocked on the door.</p>

    <p> The door opened, but no one could be seen to open it. Pippin looked into a great hall. It
        was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at either side, beyond the rows of tall pillars
        that upheld the roof. Monoliths of black marble, they rose to great capitals carved in many
        strange figures of beasts and leaves; and far above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with
        dull gold, inset with flowing traceries of many colours. No hangings nor storied webs, nor
        any things of woven stuff or of wood, were to be seen in that long solemn hall; but between
        the pillars there stood a silent company of tall images graven in cold stone.</p>
    <p> Suddenly Pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of Argonath, and awe fell on him, as he
        looked down that avenue of kings long dead. At the far end upon a dais of many steps was set
        a high throne under a canopy of marble shaped like a crowned helm; behind it was carved upon
        the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower. But the throne was empty. At the
        foot of the dais, upon the lowest step which was broad and deep, there was a stone chair,
        black and unadorned, and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap. In his hand was a white rod
        with a golden knob. He did not look up. Solemnly they paced the long floor towards him,
        until they stood three paces from his footstool. Then Gandalf spoke.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Hail, Lord and Steward of Minas Tirith, Denethor son of Ecthelion! I am come with
            counsel and tidings in this dark hour.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> Then the old man looked up. Pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones and skin like
        ivory, and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes; and he was reminded not so much
        of Boromir as of Aragorn.<quote> 'Dark indeed is the hour,' </quote>said the old man,<quote>
            'and at such times you are wont to come, Mithrandir. But though all the signs forebode
            that the doom of Gondor is drawing nigh, less now to me is that darkness than my own
            darkness. It has been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die. Is this
            he?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'One of the twain. The other is with Th�oden
            of Rohan and may come hereafter. Halflings they are, as you see, yet this is not he of
            whom the omens spoke.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yet a Halfling still,' </quote>said Denethor grimly,<quote> 'and little love do I
            bear the name, since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and drew away my
            son on the wild errand to his death. My Boromir! Now we have need of you. Faramir should
            have gone in his stead.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'He would have gone,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'Be not unjust in your grief!
            Boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. He was a masterful
            man, and one to take what he desired. I journeyed far with him and learned much of his
            mood. But you speak of his death. You have had news of that ere we came?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I have received this,' </quote>said Denethor, and laying down his rod he lifted
        from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. In each hand he held up one half of a
        great horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn bound with silver.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is the horn that Boromir always wore!' </quote>cried Pippin.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Verily,' </quote>said Denethor.<quote> 'And in my turn I bore it, and so did each
            eldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing of the
            kings, since Vorondil father of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw in the far fields of
            Rh�n. I heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen days ago, and the River
            brought it to me, broken: it will wind no more.' </quote>He paused and there was a heavy
        silence. Suddenly he turned his black glance upon Pippin.<quote> 'What say you to that,
            Halfling?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Thirteen, thirteen days,' </quote>faltered Pippin.<quote> 'Yes, I think that would
            be so. Yes, I stood beside him, as he blew the horn. But no help came. Only more
            orcs.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'So,' </quote>said Denethor, looking keenly at Pippin's face.<quote> 'You were
            there? Tell me more! Why did no help come? And how did you escape, and yet he did not,
            so mighty a man as he was, and only orcs to withstand him?'</quote></p>
    <p> Pippin flushed and forgot his fear.<quote> 'The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow,'
        </quote>he said;<quote> 'and Boromir was pierced by many. When last I saw him he sank beside
            a tree and plucked a black-feathered shaft from his side. Then I swooned and was made
            captive. I saw him no more, and know no more. But I honour his memory, for he was very
            valiant. He died to save us, my kinsman Meriadoc and myself, waylaid in the woods by the
            soldiery of the Dark Lord; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the
            less.'</quote></p>
    <p> Then Pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred strangely within him, still
        stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice.<quote> 'Little service, no doubt, will
            so great a lord of Men think to find in a hobbit, a halfling from the northern Shire;
            yet such as it is, I will offer it, in payment of my debt.' </quote>Twitching aside his
        grey cloak, Pippin drew forth his small sword and laid it at Denethor's feet.</p>
    <p> A pale smile, like a gleam of cold sun on a winter's evening, passed over the old man's
        face; but he bent his head and held out his hand, laying the shards of the horn
            aside.<quote> 'Give me the weapon!' </quote>he said.</p>
    <p> Pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him.<quote> 'Whence came this?' </quote>said
            Denethor.<quote> 'Many, many years lie on it. Surely this is a blade wrought by our own
            kindred in the North in the deep past?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country ' </quote>said
            Pippin.<quote> 'But only evil wights dwell there now, and I will not willingly tell more
            of them.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I see that strange tales are woven about you,' </quote>said Denethor,<quote> 'and
            once again it is shown that looks may belie the man � or the halfling. I accept your
            service. For you are not daunted by words; and you have courteous speech, strange though
            the sound of it may be to us in the South. And we shall have need of all folk of
            courtesy, be they great or small, in the days to come. Swear to me now!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Take the hilt,' </quote>said Gandalf,<quote> 'and speak after the Lord, if you are
            resolved on this.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I am,' </quote>said Pippin.</p>
    <p> The old man laid the sword along his lap, and Pippin put his hand to the hilt, and said
        slowly after Denethor:</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, and to the Lord and Steward of the
            realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and to go, in need or
            plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord
            release me, or death take me, or the world end. So say I, Peregrin son of Paladin of the
            Shire of the Halflings.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward of the High King, and
        I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with
        honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.' Then Pippin received back his sword and put it in its
        sheath.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And now,' </quote>said Denethor,<quote> 'my first command to you: speak and be not
            silent! Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that you can of Boromir, my
            son. Sit now and begin!' </quote>As he spoke he struck a small silver gong that stood
        near his footstool, and at once servants came forward. Pippin saw then that they had been
        standing in alcoves on either side of the door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,' </quote>said Denethor,<quote> 'and
            see that none trouble us for one hour.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,' </quote>he said to
            Gandalf.<quote> 'Much of more import, it may seem, and yet to me less pressing. But
            maybe we can speak again at the end of the day.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And earlier, it is to be hoped,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'For I have not
            ridden hither from Isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind, only
            to bring you one small warrior, however courteous. Is it naught to you that Th�oden has
            fought a great battle and that Isengard is overthrown, and that I have broken the staff
            of Saruman?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is much to me. But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel
            against the menace of the East.' </quote>He turned his dark eyes on Gandalf, and now
        Pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the strain between them, almost as if he
        saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into
        flame.</p>
    <p> Denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, more kingly,
        beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet by a sense other than sight Pippin perceived that
        Gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled. And he
        was older, far older.<quote> 'How much older?' </quote>he wondered, and then he thought how
        odd it was that he had never thought about it before. Treebeard had said something about
        wizards, but even then he had not thought of Gandalf as one of them. What was Gandalf? In
        what far time and place did he come into the world, and when would he leave it? And then his
        musings broke off, and he saw that Denethor and Gandalf still looked each other in the eye,
        as if reading the other's mind. But it was Denethor who first withdrew his gaze.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yea,' </quote>he said;<quote> 'for though the Stones be lost, they say, still the
            lords of Gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come to them. But
            sit now!'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> Then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver with a silver flagon
        and cups, and white cakes. Pippin sat down, but he could not take his eyes from the old
        lord. Was it so, or had he only imagined it, that as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam
        of his eye had glanced upon Pippin's face?</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Now tell me your tale, my liege,' </quote>said Denethor, half kindly; half
            mockingly.<quote> 'For the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome
            indeed.'</quote></p>
    <p> Pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the Lord of
        Gondor, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and all the while conscious of
        Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and (so Pippin felt) holding in check a rising
        wrath and impatience. When the hour was over and Denethor again rang the gong, Pippin felt
        worn out.<quote> 'It cannot be more than nine o'clock,' </quote>he thought.<quote> 'I could
            now eat three breakfasts on end.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Lead the Lord Mithrandir to the housing prepared for him,' </quote>said Denethor,
        'and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will. But be it known that I
        have now sworn him to my service, and he shall be known as Peregrin son of Paladin and
        taught the lesser pass-words. Send word to the Captains that they shall wait on me here, as
        soon as may be after the third hour has rung.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And you, my Lord Mithrandir, shall come too, as and when you will. None shall
            hinder your coming to me at any time, save only in my brief hours of sleep. Let your
            wrath at an old man's folly run off and then return to my comfort!'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Folly?' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'Nay, my lord, when you are a dotard you will
            die. You can use even your grief as a cloak. Do you think that I do not understand your
            purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the least, while I sit by?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'If you understand it, then be content,' </quote>returned Denethor.<quote> 'Pride
            would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need; but you deal out such gifts
            according to your own designs. Yet the Lord of Gondor is not to be made the tool of
            other men's purposes, however worthy. And to him there is no purpose higher in the world
            as it now stands than the good of Gondor; and the rule of Gondor, my lord, is mine and
            no other man's, unless the king should come again.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Unless the king should come again?' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'Well, my lord
            Steward, it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event, which few now
            look to see. In that task you shall have all the aid that you are pleased to ask for.
            But I will say this: the rule of no realm is mine, neither of Gondor nor any other,
            great or small. But all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands, those
            are my care. And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should
            perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and
            flower again in days to come. For I also am a steward. Did you not know?' </quote>And
        with that he turned and strode from the hall with Pippin running at his side.</p>
    <p> Gandalf did not look at Pippin or speak a word to him as they went. Their guide brought them
        from the doors of the hall, and then led them across the Court of the Fountain into a lane
        between tall buildings of stone. After several turns they came to a house close to the wall
        of the citadel upon the north side, not far from the shoulder that linked the hill with the
        mountain. Within, upon the first floor above the street, up a wide carven stair, he showed
        them to a fair room, light and airy, with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured. It
        was sparely furnished, having but a small table, two chairs and a bench; but at either side
        there were curtained alcoves and well-clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing.
        There were three high narrow windows that looked northward over the great curve of Anduin,
        still shrouded in mists, towards the Emyn Muil and Rauros far away. Pippin had to climb on
        the bench to look out over the deep stone sill.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Are you angry with me, Gandalf?' </quote>he said, as their guide went out and
        closed the door.<quote> 'I did the best I could.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You did indeed!' </quote>said Gandalf, laughing suddenly; and he came and stood
        beside Pippin, putting his arm about the hobbit's shoulders and gazing out of the window.
        Pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close beside his own, for the sound of that
        laugh had been gay and merry. Yet in the wizard's face he saw at first only lines of care
        and sorrow; though as he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great
        joy: a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Indeed you did your best,' </quote>said the wizard; 'and I hope that it may be long
        before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men.
        Still the Lord of Gondor learned more from you than you may have guessed, Pippin. You could
        not hide the fact that Boromir did not lead the Company from Moria, and that there was one
        among you of high honour who was coming to Minas Tirith; and that he had a famous sword. Men
        think much about the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given long thought to
        the rhyme and to the words _Isildur's Bane_, since Boromir went away.</p>
    <p> 'He is not as other men of this time, Pippin, and whatever be his descent from father to
        son, by some chance the blood of Westernesse runs nearly true in him; as it does in his
        other son, Faramir, and yet did not in Boromir whom he loved best. He has long sight. He can
        perceive, if he bends his will thither, much of what is passing in the minds of men, even of
        those that dwell far off. It is difficult to deceive him, and dangerous to try.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Remember that! For you are now sworn to his service. I do not know what put it into
            your head, or your heart, to do that. But it was well done. I did not hinder it, for
            generous deed should not be checked by cold counsel. It touched his heart, as well (may
            I say it) as pleasing his humour. And at least you are free now to move about as you
            will in Minas Tirith � when you are not on duty. For there is another side to it. You
            are at his command; and he will not forget. Be wary still!'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> He fell silent and sighed.<quote> 'Well, no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring. For
            one thing, tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today, for many days to come.
            And there is nothing more that I can do to help it. The board is set, and the pieces are
            moving. One piece that I greatly desire to find is Faramir, now the heir of Denethor. I
            do not think that he is in the City; but I have had no time to gather news. I must go.
            Pippin. I must go to this lords' </quote>council and learn what I can. But the Enemy has
        the move, and he is about to open his full game. And pawns are likely to see as much of it
        as any, Peregrin son of Paladin, soldier of Gondor. Sharpen your blade!'</p>
    <p> Gandalf went to the door, and there he turned.<quote> 'I am in haste Pippin,' </quote>he
            said.<quote> 'Do me a favour when you go out. Even before you rest, if you are not too
            weary. Go and find Shadowfax and see how he is housed. These people are kindly to
            beasts, for they are a good and wise folk, but they have less skill with horses than
            some.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> With that Gandalf went out; and as he did so, there came the note of a clear sweet bell
        ringing in a tower of the citadel. Three strokes it rang, like silver in the air, and
        ceased: the third hour from the rising of the sun.</p>
    <p> After a minute Pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked about the street. The
        sun was now shining warm and bright, and the towers and tall houses cast long clear-cut
        shadows westward. High in the blue air Mount Mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy
        cloak. Armed men went to and fro in the ways of the City, as if going at the striking of the
        hour to changes of post and duty.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nine o'clock we'd call it in the Shire,' </quote>said Pippin aloud to
            himself.<quote> 'Just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring
            sunshine. And how I should like breakfast! Do these people ever have it, or is it over?
            And when do they have dinner, and where?'</quote></p>
    <p> Presently he noticed a man, clad in black and white, coming along the narrow street from the
        centre of the citadel towards him. Pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak as the
        man passed; but he had no need. The man came straight up to him.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You are Peregrin the Halfling?' </quote>he said. 'I am told that you have been
        sworn to the service of the Lord and of the City. Welcome! He held out his hand and Pippin
        took it.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I am named Beregond son of Baranor. I have no duty this morning, and I have been
            sent to you to teach you the pass-words, and to tell you some of the many things that no
            doubt you will wish to know. And for my part, I would learn of you also. For never
            before have we seen a halfling in this land and though we have heard rumour of them,
            little is said of them in any tale that we know. Moreover you are a friend of
            Mithrandir. Do you know him well?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well,' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'I have known _of_ him all my short life, as you
            might say; and lately I have travelled far with him. But there is much to read in that
            book, and I cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two. Yet perhaps I know him as
            well as any but a few. Aragorn was the only one of our Company, I think, who really knew
            him.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Aragorn?' </quote>said Beregond.<quote> 'Who is he?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Oh,' </quote>stammered Pippin,<quote> 'he was a man who went about with us. I think
            he is in Rohan now.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You have been in Rohan, I hear. There is much that I would ask you of that land
            also; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people. But I am forgetting my
            errand, which was first to answer what you would ask. What would you know, Master
            Peregrin?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Er well,' </quote>said Pippin,<quote> 'if I may venture to say so, rather a burning
            question in my mind at present is, well, what about breakfast and all that? I mean, what
            are the meal-times, if you understand me, and where is the dining-room, if there is one?
            And the inns? I looked, but never a one could I see as we rode up, though I had been
            borne up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and
            courtly men.'</quote></p>
    <p> Beregond looked at him gravely.<quote> 'An old campaigner, I see,' </quote>he said.<quote>
            'They say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food and of
            drink; though I am not a travelled man myself. Then you have not yet eaten
            today?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, yes, to speak in courtesy, yes,' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'But no more
            than a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord; but he racked
            me for it with an hour of questions, and that is hungry work.'</quote></p>
    <p> Beregond laughed.<quote> 'At the table small men may do the greater deeds, we say. But you
            have broken your fast as well as any man in the Citadel, and with greater honour. This
            is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in posture of war. We rise ere the Sun,
            and take a morsel in the grey light, and go to our duties at the opening hour. But do
            not despair!' </quote>He laughed again, seeing the dismay in Pippin's face. 'Those who
        have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh their strength in the mid-morning. Then there
        is the nuncheon, at noon or after as duties allow; and men gather for the daymeal, and such
        mirth as there still may be, about the hour of sunset.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Come! We will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment, and eat and drink
            on the battlement, and survey the fair morning.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'One moment!' </quote>said Pippin blushing.<quote> 'Greed, or hunger by your
            courtesy, put it out of my mind. But Gandalf, Mithrandir as you call him, asked me to
            see to his horse � Shadowfax, a great steed of Rohan, and the apple of the king's eye, I
            am told, though he has given him to Mithrandir for his services. I think his new master
            loves the beast better than he loves many men, and if his good will is of any value to
            this city, you will treat Shadowfax with all honour: with greater kindness than you have
            treated this hobbit, if it is possible.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Hobbit?' </quote>said Beregond.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is what we call ourselves,' </quote>said Pippin.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I am glad to learn it,' </quote>said Beregond,<quote> 'for now I may say that
            strange accents do not mar fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. But come!
            You shall make me acquainted with this good horse. I love beasts, and we see them seldom
            in this stony city; for my people came from the mountain-vales, and before that from
            Ithilien. But fear not! The visit shall be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will
            go thence to the butteries.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> Pippin found that Shadowfax had been well housed and tended. For in the sixth circle,
        outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables where a few swift horses were
        kept, hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the Lord: messengers always ready to go
        at the urgent command of Denethor or his chief captains. But now all the horses and the
        riders were out and away.</p>
    <p> Shadowfax whinnied as Pippin entered the stable and turned his head.<quote> 'Good morning!'
        </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'Gandalf will come as soon as he may. He is busy, but he sends
            greetings, and I am to see that all is well with you; and you resting, I hope, after
            your long labours.'</quote></p>
    <p> Shadowfax tossed his head and stamped. But he allowed Beregond to handle his head gently and
        stroke his great flanks.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'He looks as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a great
            journey,' </quote>said Beregond.<quote> 'How strong and proud he is! Where is his
            harness? It should be rich and fair.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'None is rich and fair enough for him,' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'He will have
            none. If he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no bit,
            bridle, whip, or thong will tame him. Farewell, Shadowfax! Have patience. Battle is
            coming.'</quote></p>
    <p> Shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and they covered their
        ears. Then they took their leave, seeing that the manger was well filled.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And now for our manger,' </quote>said Beregond, and he led Pippin back to the
        citadel, and so to a door in the north side of the great tower. There they went down a long
        cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps. There were hatches in the walls at the side,
        and one of these was open.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'This is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the Guard.' </quote>said
            Beregond.<quote> 'Greetings, Targon!' </quote>he called through the hatch.<quote> 'It is
            early yet, but here is a newcomer that the Lord has taken into his service. He has
            ridden long and far with a tight belt, and has had sore labour this morning, and he is
            hungry. Give us what you have!'</quote></p>
    <p> They got there bread, and butter, and cheese and apples: the last of the winter store,
        wrinkled but sound and sweet; and a leather flagon of new-drawn ale, and wooden platters and
        cups. They put all into a wicker basket and climbed back into the sun; and Beregond brought
        Pippin to a place at the east end of the great out-thrust battlement where there was an
        embrasure in the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill. From there they could look out on
        the morning over the world.</p>
    <p> They ate and drank; and they talked now of Gondor and its ways and customs, now of the Shire
        and the strange countries that Pippin had seen. And ever as they talked Beregond was more
        amazed, and looked with greater wonder at the hobbit, swinging his short legs as he sat on
        the seat, or standing tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will not hide from you, Master Peregrin,' </quote>said Beregond,<quote> 'that to
            us you look almost as one of our children, a lad of nine summers or so; and yet you have
            endured perils and seen marvels that few of our greybeards could boast of. I thought it
            was the whim of our Lord to take him a noble page, after the manner of the kings of old,
            they say. But I see that it is not so, and you must pardon my foolishness.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I do,' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'Though you are not far wrong. I am still little
            more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people, and it will be four years yet before
            I "come of age", as we say in the Shire: But do not bother about me. Come and look and
            tell me what I can see.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> The sun was now climbing, and the mists in the vale below had been drawn up. The last of
        them were floating away, just overhead, as wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening
        breeze from the East, that was now flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the
        citadel. Away down in the valley-bottom, five leagues or so as the eye leaps, the Great
        River could now be seen grey and glittering, coming out of the north-west, and bending in a
        mighty sweep south and west again, till it was lost to view in a haze and shimmer, far
        beyond which lay the Sea fifty leagues away.</p>
    <p> Pippin could see all the Pelennor laid out before him, dotted into the distance with
        farmsteads and little walls, barns and byres, but nowhere could he see any kine or other
        beasts. Many roads and tracks crossed the green fields, and there was much coming and going:
        wains moving in lines towards the Great Gate, and others passing out. Now and again a
        horseman would ride up, and leap from the saddle and hasten into the City. But most of the
        traffic went out along the chief highway, and that turned south, and then bending swifter
        than the River skirted the hills and passed soon from sight. It was wide and well-paved, and
        along its eastern edge ran a broad green riding-track, and beyond that a wall. On the ride
        horsemen galloped to and fro, but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered
        wains going south. But soon Pippin saw that all was in fact well-ordered: the wains were
        moving in three lines, one swifter drawn by horses; another slower, great waggons with fair
        housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and along the west rim of the road many smaller
        carts hauled by trudging men.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is the road to the vales of Tumladen and Lossarnach, and the
            mountain-villages, and then on to Lebennin,' </quote>said Beregond.<quote> 'There go the
            last of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children, and the women that
            must go with them. They must all be gone from the Gate and the road clear for a league
            before noon: that was the order. It is a sad necessity.' </quote>He sighed.<quote> 'Few,
            maybe, of those now sundered will meet again. And there were always too few children in
            this city; but now there are none-save some young lads that will not depart, and may
            find some task to do: my own son is one of them.'</quote></p>
    <p> They fell silent for a while. Pippin gazed anxiously eastward, as if at any moment he might
        see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields.<quote> 'What can I see there?' </quote>he
        asked, pointing down to the middle of the great curve of the Anduin.<quote> 'Is that another
            city, or what is it?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It was a city,' </quote>said Beregond,<quote> 'the chief city of Gondor, of which
            this was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of Osgiliath on either side of Anduin,
            which our enemies took and burned long ago. Yet we won it back in the days of the youth
            of Denethor: not to dwell in, but to hold as an outpost, and to rebuild the bridge for
            the passage of our arms. And then came the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The Black Riders?' </quote>said Pippin, opening his eyes, and they were wide and
        dark with an old fear re-awakened.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, they were black,' </quote>said Beregond,<quote> 'and I see that you know
            something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I know of them,' </quote>said Pippin softly,<quote> 'but I will not speak of them
            now, so near, so near.' </quote>He broke off and lifted his eyes above the River, and it
        seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening shadow. Perhaps it was
        mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty
        leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a cloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper
        gloom. But even as he looked it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering,
        very slowly, slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'So near to Mordor?' </quote>said Beregond quietly.<quote> 'Yes, there it lies. We
            seldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow: sometimes it seems
            fainter and more distant; sometimes nearer and darker. It is growing and darkening now;
            and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too. And the Fell Riders, less than a year ago
            they won back the crossings, and many of our best men were slain. Boromir it was that
            drove the enemy at last back from this western shore, and we hold still the near half of
            Osgiliath. For a little while. But we await now a new onslaught there. Maybe the chief
            onslaught of the war that comes.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'When?' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'Have you a guess? For I saw the beacons last
            night and the errand-riders; and Gandalf said that it was a sign that war had begun. He
            seemed in a desperate hurry. But now everything seems to have slowed up
        again.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Only because everything is now ready,' </quote>said Beregond.<quote> 'It is but the
            deep breath before the plunge.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But why were the beacons lit last night?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged,' </quote>answered
        Beregond. 'But I do not know the counsel of the Lord and his captains. They have many ways
        of gathering news. And the Lord Denethor is unlike other men: he sees far. Some say that as
        he sits alone in his high chamber in the Tower at night, and bends his thought this way and
        that, he can read somewhat of the future; and that he will at times search even the mind of
        the Enemy, wrestling with him. And so it is that he is old, worn before his time. But
        however that may be, my lord Faramir is abroad, beyond the River on some perilous errand,
        and he may have sent tidings.</p>
    <p> 'But if you would know what I think set the beacons ablaze, it was the news that came
        yestereve out of Lebennin. There is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths of Anduin,
        manned by the corsairs of Umbar in the South. They have long ceased to fear the might of
        Gondor, and they have allied them with the Enemy, and now make a heavy stroke in his cause.
        For this attack will draw off much of the help that we looked to have from Lebennin and
        Belfalas, where folk are hardy and numerous. All the more do our thoughts go north to Rohan;
        and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that you bring.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And yet' </quote>� he paused and stood up, and looked round, north, east, and south
        � 'the doings at Isengard should warn us that we are caught now in a great net and strategy.
        This is no longer a bickering at the fords, raiding from Ithilien and from An�rien,
        ambushing and pillaging. This is a great war long-planned, and we are but one piece in it,
        whatever pride may say. Things move in the far East beyond the Inland Sea, it is reported;
        and north in Mirkwood and beyond; and south in Harad. And now all realms shall be put to the
        test, to stand, or fall � under the Shadow.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yet, Master Peregrin, we have this honour: ever we bear the brunt of the chief
            hatred of the Dark Lord, for that hatred comes down out of the depths of time and over
            the deeps of the Sea. Here will the hammer-stroke fall hardest. And for that reason
            Mithrandir came hither in such haste. For if we fall, who shall stand? And, Master
            Peregrin, do you see any hope that we shall stand?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> Pippin did not answer. He looked at the great walls, and the towers and brave banners, and
        the sun in the high sky, and then at the gathering gloom in the East; and he thought of the
        long fingers of that Shadow: of the orcs in the woods and the mountains, the treason of
        Isengard, the birds of evil eye, and the Black Riders even in the lanes of the Shire � and
        of the winged terror, the Nazg�l. He shuddered, and hope seemed to wither. And even at that
        moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured, as though a dark wing had passed
        across it. Almost beyond hearing he thought he caught, high and far up in the heavens, a
        cry: faint, but heart-quelling, cruel and cold. He blanched and cowered against the
        wall.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'What was that?' </quote>asked Beregond.<quote> 'You also felt
        something?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes,' </quote>muttered Pippin.<quote> 'It is the sign of our fall, and the shadow
            of doom, a Fell Rider of the air.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, the shadow of doom,' </quote>said Beregond.<quote> 'I fear that Minas Tirith
            shall fall. Night comes. The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> For a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak. Then suddenly Pippin looked
        up and saw that the sun was still shining and the banners still streaming in the breeze. He
        shook himself.<quote> 'It is passed,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'No, my heart will not yet
            despair. Gandalf fell and has returned and is with us. We may stand, if only on one leg,
            or at least be left still upon our knees.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Rightly said!' </quote>cried Beregond, rising and striding to and fro.<quote> 'Nay,
            though all things must come utterly to an end in time, Gondor shall not perish yet. Not
            though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of carrion before
            them. There are still other fastnesses, and secret ways of escape into the mountains.
            Hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is
            green.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'All the same, I wish it was over for good or ill.' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'I
            am no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge of one
            that I can't escape is worst of all. What a long day it seems already! I should be
            happier, if we were not obliged to stand and watch, making no move, striking nowhere
            first. No stroke would have been struck in Rohan, I think, but for Gandalf.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!' </quote>said
            Beregond.<quote> 'But things may change when Faramir returns. He is bold, more bold than
            many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be wise and
            learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man of hardihood and swift
            judgement in the field. But such is Faramir. Less reckless and eager than Boromir, but
            not less resolute. Yet what indeed can he do? We cannot assault the mountains of � of
            yonder realm. Our reach is shortened, and we cannot strike till some foe comes within
            it. Then our hand must be heavy!' </quote>He smote the hilt of his sword.</p>
    <p> Pippin looked at him: tall and proud and noble, as all the men that he had yet seen in that
        land; and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle.<quote> 'Alas! my own hand
            feels as light as a feather,' </quote>he thought, but he said nothing.<quote> 'A pawn
            did Gandalf say? Perhaps but on the wrong chessboard.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> So they talked until the sun reached its height, and suddenly the noon-bells were rung, and
        there was a stir in the citadel; for all save the watchmen were going to their meal.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Will you come with me?' </quote>said Beregond.<quote> 'You may join my mess for
            this day. I do not know to what company you will be assigned; or the Lord may hold you
            at his own command. But you will be welcome. And it will be well to meet as many men as
            you may, while there is yet time.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I shall be glad to come,' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'I am lonely, to tell you the
            truth. I left my best friend behind in Rohan, and I have had no one to talk to or jest
            with. Perhaps I could really join your company? Are you the captain? If so, you could
            take me on, or speak for me?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nay, nay,' </quote>Beregond laughed,<quote> 'I am no captain. Neither office nor
            rank nor lordship have I, being but a plain man of arms of the Third Company of the
            Citadel. Yet, Master Peregrin, to be only a man of arms of the Guard of the Tower of
            Gondor is held worthy in the City, and such men have honour in the land.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then it is far beyond me,' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'Take me back to our room,
            and if Gandalf is not there, I will go where you like � as your guest.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> Gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so Pippin went with Beregond and was
        made known to the men of the Third Company. And it seemed that Beregond got as much honour
        from it as his guest, for Pippin was very welcome. There had already been much talk in the
        citadel about Mithrandir's companion and his long closeting with the Lord; and rumour
        declared that a Prince of the Halflings had come out of the North to offer allegiance to
        Gondor and five thousand swords. And some said that when the Riders came from Rohan each
        would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small maybe, but doughty.</p>
    <p> Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could not be rid of his new
        rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by Boromir and honoured by the Lord
        Denethor; and they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and stories of
        the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish. Indeed his only trouble
        was to be<quote> 'wary' </quote>according to the counsel of Gandalf, and not to let his
        tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends.</p>

    <p> At length Beregond rose.<quote> 'Farewell for this time!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'I have
            duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, I think. But if you are lonely, as
            you say, maybe you would like a merry guide about the City. My son would go with you
            gladly. A good lad, I may say. If that pleases you, go down to the lowest circle and ask
            for the Old Guesthouse in the Rath Celerdain, the Lampwrights' </quote>Street. You will
        find him there with other lads that are remaining in the City. There may be things worth
        seeing down at the Great Gate ere the closing.'</p>
    <p> He went out, and soon after all the others followed. The day was still fine, though it was
        growing hazy, and it was hot for March, even so far southwards. Pippin felt sleepy, but the
        lodging seemed cheerless, and he decided to go down and explore the City. He took a few
        morsels that he had saved to Shadowfax, and they were graciously accepted, though the horse
        seemed to have no lack. Then he walked on down many winding ways.</p>
    <p> People stared much as he passed. To his face men were gravely courteous, saluting him after
        the manner of Gondor with bowed head and hands upon the breast; but behind him he heard many
        calls, as those out of doors cried to others within to come and see the Prince of the
        Halflings, the companion of Mithrandir. Many used some other tongue than the Common Speech,
        but it was not long before he learned at least what was meant by _Ernil i Pheriannath_ and
        knew that his title had gone down before him into the City.</p>
    <p> He came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to the lowest and
        widest circle, and there he was directed to the Lampwrights' Street, a broad way running
        towards the Great Gate. In it he found the Old Guesthouse, a large building of grey
        weathered stone with two wings running back from the street, and between them a narrow
        greensward, behind which was the many-windowed house, fronted along its whole width by a
        pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass. Boys were playing among the
        pillars, the only children that Pippin had seen in Minas Tirith, and he stopped to look at
        them. Presently one of them caught sight of him, and with a shout he sprang across the grass
        and came into the street, followed by several others. There he stood in front of Pippin,
        looking him up and down.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Greetings!' </quote>said the lad.<quote> 'Where do you come from? You are a
            stranger in the City.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I was,' </quote>said Pippin;<quote> 'but they say I have become a man of
            Gondor.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Oh come!' </quote>said the lad.<quote> 'Then we are all men here. But how old are
            you, and what is your name? I am ten years already, and shall soon be five feet. I am
            taller than you. But then my father is a Guard, one of the tallest. What is your
            father?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Which question shall I answer first?' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'My father farms
            the lands round Whitwell near Tuckborough in the Shire. I am nearly twenty-nine, so I
            pass you there; though I am but four feet, and not likely to grow any more, save
            sideways.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Twenty-nine!' </quote>said the lad and whistled.<quote> 'Why, you are quite old! As
            old as my uncle Iorlas. Still,' </quote>he added hopefully,<quote> 'I wager I could
            stand you on your head or lay you on your back.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Maybe you could, if I let you,' </quote>said Pippin with a laugh.<quote> 'And maybe
            I could do the same to you: we know some wrestling tricks in my little country. Where,
            let me tell you, I am considered uncommonly large and strong; and I have never allowed
            anyone to stand me on my head. So if it came to a trial and nothing else would serve, I
            might have to kill you. For when you are older, you will learn that folk are not always
            what they seem; and though you may have taken me for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey,
            let me warn you: I am not, I am a halfling, hard, bold, and wicked!' </quote>Pippin
        pulled such a grim face that the boy stepped back a pace, but at once he returned with
        clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'No!' </quote>Pippin laughed.<quote> 'Don't believe what strangers say of themselves
            either! I am not a fighter. But it would be politer in any case for the challenger to
            say who he is.'</quote></p>
    <p> The boy drew himself up proudly.<quote> 'I am Bergil son of Beregond of the Guards,'
        </quote>he said.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'So I thought,' </quote>said Pippin,<quote> 'for you look like your father. I know
            him and he sent me to find you.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then why did you not say so at once?' </quote>said Bergil, and suddenly a look of
        dismay came over his face.<quote> 'Do not tell me that he has changed his mind, and will
            send me away with the maidens! But no, the last wains have gone.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'His message is less bad than that, if not good.' </quote>said Pippin.<quote> 'He
            says that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head, you might show me round the
            City for a while and cheer my loneliness. I can tell you some tales of far countries in
            return.'</quote></p>
    <p> Bergil clapped his hands, and laughed with relief.<quote> 'All is well,' </quote>he
            cried.<quote> 'Come then! We were soon going to the Gate to look on. We will go
            now.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'What is happening there?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The Captains of the Outlands are expected up the South Road ere sundown. Come with
            us and you will see.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p> Bergil proved a good comrade, the best company Pippin had had since he parted from Merry,
        and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the streets, heedless of
        the many glances that men gave them. Before long they found themselves in a throng going
        towards the Great Gate. There Pippin went up much in the esteem of Bergil, for when he spoke
        his name and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and what was
        more, he allowed him to take his companion with him.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That is good!' </quote>said Bergil.<quote> 'We boys are no longer allowed to pass
            the Gate without an elder. Now we shall see better.'</quote></p>
    <p> Beyond the Gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of the great paved
        space into which all the ways to Minas Tirith ran. All eyes were turned southwards, and soon
        a murmur rose:<quote> 'There is dust away there! They are coming!'</quote></p>
    <p> Pippin and Bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd, and waited. Horns
        sounded at some distance, and the noise of cheering rolled towards them like a gathering
        wind. Then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and all about them people were shouting.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Forlong! Forlong!' </quote>Pippin heard men calling.<quote> 'What do they say?'
        </quote>he asked.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Forlong has come,' </quote>Bergil answered;<quote> 'old Forlong the Fat, the Lord
            of Lossarnach. That is where my grandsire lives. Hurrah! Here he is. Good old
            Forlong!'</quote></p>
    <p> Leading the line there came walking a big thick-limbed horse, and on it sat a man of wide
        shoulders and huge girth, but old and grey-bearded, yet mail-clad and black-helmed and
        bearing a long heavy spear. Behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men, well-armed and
        bearing great battle-axes; grim-faced they were, and shorter and somewhat swarthier than any
        men that Pippin had yet seen in Gondor.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Forlong!' </quote>men shouted.<quote> 'True heart, true friend! Forlong!'
        </quote>But when the men of Lossarnach had passed they muttered:<quote> 'So few! Two
            hundreds, what are they? We hoped for ten times the number. That will be the new tidings
            of the black fleet. They are sparing only a tithe of their strength. Still every little
            is a gain.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> And so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed through the Gate, men of
        the Outlands marching to defend the City of Gondor in a dark hour; but always too few,
        always less than hope looked for or need asked. The men of Ringl� Vale behind the son of
        their lord, Dervorin striding on foot: three hundreds. From the uplands of Morthond, the
        great Blackroot Vale, tall Duinhir with his sons, Duilin and Derufin, and five hundred
        bowmen. From the Anfalas, the Langstrand far away, a long line of men of many sorts, hunters
        and herdsmen and men of little villages, scantily equipped save for the household of
        Golasgil their lord. From Lamedon, a few grim hillmen without a captain. Fisher-folk of the
        Ethir, some hundred or more spared from the ships. Hirluin the Fair of the Green Hills from
        Pinnath Gelin with three hundreds of gallant green-clad men. And last and proudest, Imrahil,
        Prince of Dol Amroth, kinsman of the Lord, with gilded banners bearing his token of the Ship
        and the Silver Swan, and a company of knights in full harness riding grey horses; and behind
        them seven hundreds of men at arms, tall as lords, grey-eyed, dark-haired, singing as they
        came.</p>
    <p> And that was all, less than three thousands full told. No more would come. Their cries and
        the tramp of their feet passed into the City and died away. The onlookers stood silent for a
        while. Dust hung in the air, for the wind had died and the evening was heavy. Already the
        closing hour was drawing nigh, and the red sun had gone behind Mindolluin. Shadow came down
        on the City.</p>
    <p> Pippin looked up, and it seemed to him that the sky had grown ashen-grey, as if a vast dust
        and smoke hung above them, and light came dully through it. But in the West the dying sun
        had set all the fume on fire, and now Mindolluin stood black against a burning smoulder
        flecked with embers.<quote> 'So ends a fair day in wrath!' </quote>he said forgetful of the
        lad at his side.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'So it will, if I have not returned before the sundown-bells,' </quote>said
            Bergil.<quote> 'Come! There goes the trumpet for the closing of the Gate.'</quote></p>
    <p/>
    <p> Hand in hand they went back into the City, the last to pass the Gate before it was shut; and
        as they reached the Lampwrights' Street all the bells in the towers tolled solemnly. Lights
        sprang in many windows, and from the houses and wards of the men at arms along the walls
        there came the sound of song.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Farewell for this time,' </quote>said Bergil.<quote> 'Take my greetings to my
            :father, and thank him for the company that he sent. Come again soon, I beg. Almost I
            wish now that there was no war, for we might have had some merry times. We might have
            journeyed to Lossarnach, to my grandsire's house; it is good to be there in Spring, the
            woods and fields are full of flowers. But maybe we will go thither together yet. They
            will never overcome our Lord, and my father is very valiant. Farewell and
            return!'</quote></p>
    <p> They parted and Pippin hurried back towards the citadel. It seemed a long way, and he grew
        hot and very hungry; and night closed down swift and dark. Not a star pricked the sky. He
        was late for the daymeal in the mess, and Beregond greeted him gladly, and sat him at his
        side to hear news of his son. After the meal Pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave,
        for a strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf again.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Can you find your way?' </quote>said Beregond at the door of the small hall, on the
        north side of the citadel, where they had sat.<quote> 'It is a black night, and all the
            blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the City, and none are to
            shine out from the walls. And I can give you news of another order: you will be summoned
            to the Lord Denethor early tomorrow. I fear you will not be for the Third Company. Still
            we may hope to meet again. Farewell and sleep in peace!'</quote></p>
    <p> The lodging was dark, save for a little lantern set on the table. Gandalf was not there.
        Gloom settled still more heavily on Pippin. He climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of
        a window, but it was like looking into a pool of ink. He got down and closed the shutter and
        went to bed. For a while he lay and listened for sounds of Gandalf's return, and then he
        fell into an uneasy sleep.</p>
    <p> In the night he was wakened by a light, and he saw that Gandalf had come and was pacing to
        and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. There were candles on the table and
        rolls of parchment. He heard the wizard sigh, and mutter:<quote> 'When will Faramir
            return?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Hullo!' </quote>said Pippin, poking his head round the curtain.<quote> 'I thought
            you had forgotten all about me. I am glad to see you back. It has been a long
            day.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But the night will be too short,' </quote>said Gandalf.<quote> 'I have come back
            here, for I must have a little peace, alone. You should sleep, in a bed while you still
            may. At the sunrise I shall take you to the Lord Denethor again. No, when the summons
            comes, not at sunrise. The Darkness has begun. There will be no dawn.'</quote></p>
    <p/>

    <chapter>_Chapter 2_</chapter>
    <p> The Passing of the Grey Company</p>

    <p> Gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of Shadowfax were lost in the night, when Merry
        came back to Aragorn. He had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at Parth Galen,
        and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of Isengard.
        Hasufel was already saddled. Legolas and Gimli with their horse stood close by.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'So four of the Company still remain,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'We will ride on
            together. But we shall not go alone, as I thought. The king is now determined to set out
            at once. Since the coming of the winged shadow, he desires to return to the hills under
            cover of night.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And then whither?' </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I cannot say yet,' </quote>Aragorn answered.<quote> 'As for the king, he will go to
            the muster that he commanded at Edoras, four nights from now. And there, I think, he
            will hear tidings of war, and the Riders of Rohan will go down to Minas Tirith. But for
            myself, and any that will go with me . . .'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I for one!' </quote>cried Legolas.<quote> 'And Gimli with him!' </quote>said the
        Dwarf.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Well, for myself,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'it is dark before me. I must go
            down also to Minas Tirith, but I do not yet see the road. An hour long prepared
            approaches.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Don't leave me behind!' </quote>said Merry.<quote> 'I have not been of much use
            yet; but I don't want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is over.
            I don't think the Riders will want to be bothered with me now. Though, of course, the
            king did say that I was to sit by him when he came to his house and tell him all about
            the Shire.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'and your road lies with him, I think, Merry.
            But do not look for mirth at the ending. It will be long, I fear, ere Th�oden sits at
            ease again in Meduseld. Many hopes will wither in this bitter Spring.'</quote></p>
    <p> Soon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with Gimli behind Legolas, and Merry in
        front of Aragorn. Presently they were riding swiftly through the night. They had not long
        passed the mounds at the Fords of Isen, when a Rider galloped up from the rear of their
        line.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'My lord,' </quote>he said to the king,<quote> 'there are horsemen behind us. As we
            crossed the fords I thought that I heard them. Now we are sure. They are overtaking us,
            riding hard.'</quote></p>
    <p> Th�oden at once called a halt. The Riders turned about and seized their spears. Aragorn
        dismounted and set Merry on the ground, and drawing his sword he stood by the king's
        stirrup. �omer and his esquire rode back to the rear. Merry felt more like unneeded baggage
        than ever, and he wondered, if there was a fight, what he should do. Supposing the king's
        small escort was trapped and overcome, but he escaped into the darkness � alone in the wild
        fields of Rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles?<quote> 'No good!'
        </quote>he thought. He drew his sword and tightened his belt.</p>
    <p> The sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but suddenly it rode out clear
        again. Then they all heard the sound of hoofs, and at the same moment they saw dark shapes
        coming swiftly on the path from the fords. The moonlight glinted here and there on the
        points of spears. The number of the pursuers could not be told, but they seemed no fewer
        than the king's escort, at the least.</p>
    <p> When they were some fifty paces off, �omer cried in a loud voice:<quote> 'Halt! Halt! Who
            rides in Rohan?'</quote></p>
    <p> The pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand. A silence followed: and then in the
        moonlight, a horseman could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forward. His hand showed
        white as he held it up, palm outward, in token of peace; but the king's men gripped their
        weapons. At ten paces the man stopped. He was tall, a dark standing shadow. Then his clear
        voice rang out.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Rohan? Rohan did you say? That is a glad word. We seek that land in haste from long
            afar.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You have found it,' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'When you crossed the fords yonder
            you entered it. But it is the realm of Th�oden the King. None ride here save by his
            leave. Who are you? And what is your haste?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Halbarad D�nadan, Ranger of the North I am,' </quote>cried the man.<quote> 'We seek
            one Aragorn son of Arathorn, and we heard that he was in Rohan.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And you have found him also!' </quote>cried Aragorn. Giving his reins to Merry, he
        ran forward and embraced the newcomer.<quote> 'Halbarad!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Of all
            joys this is the least expected!'</quote></p>
    <p> Merry breathed a sigh of relief. He had thought that this was some last trick of Saruman's,
        to waylay the king while he had only a few men about him; but it seemed that there would be
        no need to die in Th�oden's defence, not yet at any rate. He sheathed his sword.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'All is well,' </quote>said Aragorn, turning back.<quote> 'Here are some of my own
            kin from the far land where I dwelt. But why they come, and how many they be, Halbarad
            shall tell us.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I have thirty with me,' </quote>said Halbarad.<quote> 'That is all of our kindred
            that could be gathered in haste; but the brethren Elladan and Elrohir have ridden with
            us, desiring to go to the war. We rode as swiftly as we might when your summons
            came.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But I did not summon you,' </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'save only in wish. My
            thoughts have often turned to you, and seldom more than tonight; yet I have sent no
            word. But come! All such matters must wait. You find us riding in haste and danger. Ride
            with us now, if the king will give his leave.'</quote></p>
    <p> Th�oden was indeed glad of the news.<quote> 'It is well!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'If these
            kinsmen be in any way like to yourself, my lord Aragorn, thirty such knights will be a
            strength that cannot be counted by heads.'</quote></p>
    <p> Then the Riders set out again, and Aragorn for a while rode with the D�nedain; and when they
        had spoken of tidings in the North and in the South, Elrohir said to him:</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I bring word to you from my father: _The days are short. If thou art in haste,
            remember the Paths of the Dead_.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire,' </quote>answered
            Aragorn.<quote> 'But great indeed will be my haste ere I take that road.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That will soon be seen,' </quote>said Elrohir.<quote> 'But let us speak no more of
            these things upon the open road!'</quote></p>
    <p> And Aragorn said to Halbarad:<quote> 'What is that that you bear, kinsman?' </quote>For he
        saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff, as it were a standard, but it was
        close-furled in a black cloth bound about with many thongs.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is a gift that I bring you from the Lady of Rivendell,' </quote>answered
            Halbarad.<quote> 'She wrought it in secret, and long was the making. But she also sends
            word to you: _The days now are short. Either our hope cometh, or all hopes end.
            Therefore I send thee what I have made for thee. Fare well, Elfstone!_'</quote></p>
    <p> And Aragorn said:<quote> 'Now I know what you bear. Bear it still for me a while!'
        </quote>And he turned and looked away to the North under the great stars, and then he fell
        silent and spoke no more while the night's journey lasted.</p>
    <p> The night was old and the East grey when they rode up at last from Deeping-coomb and came
        back to the Hornburg. There they were to lie and rest for a brief while and take
        counsel.</p>
    <p> Merry slept until he was roused by Legolas and Gimli.<quote> 'The Sun is high,' </quote>said
            Legolas.<quote> 'All others are up and doing. Come, Master Sluggard, and look at this
            place while you may!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There was a battle here three nights ago,' </quote>said Gimli,<quote> 'and here
            Legolas and I played a game that I won only by a single orc. Come and see how it was!
            And there are caves, Merry, caves of wonder! Shall we visit them, Legolas, do you
            think?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nay! There is no time,' </quote>said the Elf.<quote> 'Do not spoil the wonder with
            haste! I have given you my word to return hither with you, if a day of peace and freedom
            comes again. But it is now near to noon, and at that hour we eat, and then set out
            again, I hear.'</quote></p>
    <p> Merry got up and yawned. His few hours' sleep had not been nearly enough; he was tired and
        rather dismal. He missed Pippin, and felt that he was only a burden, while everybody was
        making plans for speed in a business that he did not fully understand.<quote> 'Where is
            Aragorn?' </quote>he asked.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'In a high chamber of the Burg,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'He has neither rested
            nor slept, I think. He went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take thought,
            and only his kinsman, Halbarad, went with him; but some dark doubt or care sits on
            him.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'They are a strange company, these newcomers,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Stout men
            and lordly they are, and the Riders of Rohan look almost as boys beside them; for they
            are grim men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most part, even as Aragorn
            himself; and they are silent.'</quote></p>

        <quote> 'But even as Aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence.' </quote>said
            Legolas.<quote> 'And have you marked the brethren Elladan and Elrohir? Less sombre is
            their gear than the others',</quote> and they are fair and gallant as Elven-lords; and
        that is not to be wondered at in the sons of Elrond of Rivendell.'</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Why have they come? Have you heard?' </quote>asked Merry. He had now dressed, and
        he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and the three passed out together towards the
        ruined gate of the Burg.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'They answered a summons, as you heard,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'Word came to
            Rivendell, they say: _Aragorn has need of his kindred. Let the D�nedain ride to him in
            Rohan!_ But whence this message came they are now in doubt. Gandalf sent it, I would
            guess.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nay, Galadriel,' </quote>said Legolas.<quote> 'Did she not speak through Gandalf of
            the ride of the Grey Company from the North?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Yes, you have it,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'The Lady of the Wood! She read many
            hearts and desires. Now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk,
            Legolas?'</quote></p>
    <p> Legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and east, and his fair
        face was troubled.<quote> 'I do not think that any would come,' </quote>he answered.<quote>
            'They have no need to ride to war; war already marches on their own lands.'</quote></p>
    <p> For a while the three companions walked together, speaking of this and that turn of the
        battle, and they went down from the broken gate, and passed the mounds of the fallen on the
        greensward beside the road, until they stood on Helm's Dike and looked into the Coomb. The
        Death Down already stood there, black and tall and stony, and the great trampling and
        scoring of the grass by the Huorns could be plainly seen. The Dunlendings and many men of
        the garrison of the Burg were at work on the Dike or in the fields and about the battered
        walls behind; yet all seemed strangely quiet: a weary valley resting after a great storm.
        Soon they turned back and went to the midday meal in the hall of the Burg.</p>
    <p> The king was already there, and as soon as they entered he called for Merry and had a seat
        set for him at his side.<quote> 'It is not as I would have it,' </quote>said Th�oden;<quote>
            'for this is little like my fair house in Edoras. And your friend is gone, who should
            also be here. But it may be long ere we sit, you and I, at the high table in Meduseld;
            there will be no time for feasting when I return thither. But come now! Eat and drink,
            and let us speak together while we may. And then you shall ride with me.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'May I?' </quote>said Merry, surprised and delighted.<quote> 'That would be
            splendid!' </quote>He had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words.<quote> 'I
            am afraid I am only in everybody's way,' </quote>he stammered;<quote> 'but I should like
            to do anything I could, you know.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I doubt it not,' </quote>said the king.<quote> 'I have had a good hill-pony made
            ready for you. He will bear you as swift as any horse by the roads that we shall take.
            For I will ride from the Burg by mountain paths, not by the plain, and so come to Edoras
            by way of Dunharrow where the Lady �owyn awaits me. You shall be my esquire, if you
            will. Is there gear of war in this place, �omer, that my sword-thain could
        use?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There are no great weapon-hoards here, lord.' </quote>answered �omer.<quote> 'Maybe
            a light helm might be found to fit him; but we have no mail or sword for one of his
            stature.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I have a sword,' </quote>said Merry, climbing from his seat, and drawing from its
        black sheath his small bright blade. Filled suddenly with love for this old man, he knelt on
        one knee, and took his hand and kissed it.<quote> 'May I lay the sword of Meriadoc of the
            Shire on your lap Th�oden King?' </quote>he cried.<quote> 'Receive my service, if you
            will!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Gladly will I take it,' </quote>said the king; and laying his long old hands upon
        the brown hair of the hobbit; he blessed him.<quote> 'Rise now, Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan
            of the household of Meduseld!' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Take your sword and bear it unto
            good fortune!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'As a father you shall be to me,' </quote>said Merry.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'For a little while,' </quote>said Th�oden.</p>

    <p> They talked then together as they ate, until presently �omer spoke.<quote> 'It is near the
            hour that we set for our going, lord,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Shall I bid men sound
            the horns? But where is Aragorn? His place is empty and he has not eaten.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'We will make ready to ride,' </quote>said Th�oden;<quote> 'but let word be sent to
            the Lord Aragorn that the hour is nigh.'</quote></p>
    <p> The king with his guard and Merry at his side passed down from the gate of the Burg to where
        the Riders were assembling on the green. Many were already mounted. It would be a great
        company; for the king was leaving only a small garrison in the Burg, and all who could be
        spared were riding to the weapontake at Edoras. A thousand spears had indeed already ridden
        away at night; but still there would be some five hundred more to go with the king, for the
        most part men from the fields and dales of Westfold.</p>
    <p> A little apart the Rangers sat, silent, in an ordered company, armed with spear and bow and
        sword. They were clad in cloaks of dark grey, and their hoods were cast now over helm and
        head. Their horses were strong and of proud bearing, but rough-haired; and one stood there
        without a rider, Aragorn's own horse that they had brought from the North; Roheryn was his
        name. There was no gleam of stone or gold, nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness:
        nor did their riders bear any badge or token, save only that each cloak was pinned upon the
        left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star.</p>
    <p> The king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside him on his pony: Stybba was his
        name. Presently �omer came out from the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing
        the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike
        were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and
        their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. Behind them
        walked Legolas and Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for Aragorn, so startling was the change
        that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had fallen on his head. Grim was his face,
        grey-hued and weary.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I am troubled in mind, lord,' </quote>he said, standing by the king's horse.<quote>
            'I have heard strange words, and I see new perils far off. I have laboured long in
            thought, and now I fear that I must change my purpose. Tell me, Th�oden, you ride now to
            Dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is now a full hour past noon,' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'Before the night of
            the third day from now we should come to the Hold. The Moon will then be one night past
            his full, and the muster that the king commanded will be held the day after. More speed
            we cannot make, if the strength of Rohan is to be gathered.'</quote></p>
    <p> Aragorn was silent for a moment.<quote> 'Three days,' </quote>he murmured,<quote> 'and the
            muster of Rohan will only be begun. But I see that it cannot now be hastened.'
        </quote>He looked up, and it seemed that he had made some decision; his face was less
        troubled. Then, by our leave, lord, I must take new counsel for myself and my kindred. We
        must ride our own road, and no longer in secret. For me the time of stealth has passed. I
        will ride east by the swiftest way, and I will take the Paths of the Dead.'</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The Paths of the Dead!' </quote>said Th�oden, and trembled.<quote> 'Why do you
            speak of them?' </quote>�omer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it seemed to Merry that
        the faces of the Riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words.<quote> 'If there
            be in truth such paths,' </quote>said Th�oden,<quote> 'their gate is in Dunharrow; but
            no living man may pass it.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Alas! Aragorn my friend!' </quote>said �omer.<quote> 'I had hoped that we should
            ride to war together; but if you seek the Paths of the Dead, then our parting is come,
            and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the Sun.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That road I will take, nonetheless,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'But I say to
            you, �omer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor should
            stand between.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You will do as you will, my lord Aragorn,' </quote>said Th�oden.<quote> 'It is your
            doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. This parting grieves me, and
            my strength is lessened by it; but now I must take the mountain-roads and delay no
            longer. Farewell!'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Farewell, lord!' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'Ride unto great renown! Farewell,
            Merry! I leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to
            Fangorn. Legolas and Gimli will still hunt with me, I hope; but we shall not forget
            you.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Good-bye!' </quote>said Merry. He could find no more to say. He felt very small,
        and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. More than ever he missed the
        unquenchable cheerfulness of Pippin. The Riders were ready, and their horses were fidgeting;
        he wished they would start arid get it over.</p>
    <p> Now Th�oden spoke to �omer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, and with that word
        the Riders set forth. They rode over the Dike and down the Coomb, and then, turning swiftly
        eastwards, they took a path that skirted the foothills for a mile or so, until bending south
        it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view. Aragorn rode to the Dike and
        watched till the king's men were far down the Coomb. Then he turned to Halbarad.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'There go three that I love, and the smallest not the least,' </quote>he
            said.<quote> 'He knows not to what end he rides; yet if he knew, he still would go
            on.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'A little people, but of great worth are the Shire-folk,' </quote>said
            Halbarad.<quote> 'Little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of their
            borders, and yet I grudge it not.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And now our fates are woven together,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'And yet, alas!
            here we must part. Well, I must eat a little, and then we also must hasten away. Come,
            Legolas and Gimli! I must speak with you as I eat.'</quote></p>
    <p> Together they went back into the Burg; yet for some time Aragorn sat silent at the table in
        the hall, and the others waited for him to speak.<quote> 'Come!' </quote>said Legolas at
            last.<quote> 'Speak and be comforted, and shake off the shadow! What has happened since
            we came back to this grim place in the grey morning?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'A struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the Hornburg,'
        </quote>answered Aragorn.<quote> 'I have looked in the Stone of Orthanc, my
            friends.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry!' </quote>exclaimed Gimli with
        fear and astonishment in his face.<quote> 'Did you say aught to � him? Even Gandalf feared
            that encounter.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'You forget to whom you speak,' </quote>said Aragorn sternly, and his eyes
            glinted.<quote> 'Did I not openly proclaim my title before the doors of Edoras? What do
            you fear that I should say to him? Nay, Gimli,' </quote>he said in a softer voice, and
        the grimness left his face, and he looked like one who has laboured in sleepless pain for
        many nights.<quote> 'Nay, my friends, I and the lawful master of the Stone, and I had both
            the right and the strength to use it, or so I judged. The right cannot be doubted. The
            strength was enough � barely.'</quote></p>
    <p> He drew a deep breath.<quote> 'It was a bitter struggle, and the weariness is slow to pass.
            I spoke no word to him, and in the end I wrenched the Stone to my own will. That alone
            he will find hard to endure. And he beheld me. Yes, Master Gimli, he saw me, but in
            other guise than you see me here. If that will aid him, then I have done ill. But I do
            not think so. To know that I lived and walked the earth was a blow to his heart, I deem;
            for he knew it not till now. The eyes in Orthanc did not see through the armour of
            Th�oden; but Sauron has not forgotten Isildur and the sword of Elendil. Now in the very
            hour of his great designs the heir of Isildur and the Sword are revealed; for I showed
            the blade re-forged to him. He is not so mighty yet that he is above fear; nay, doubt
            ever gnaws him.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But he wields great dominion, nonetheless,' </quote>said Gimli;<quote> 'and now he
            will strike more swiftly.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The hasty stroke goes oft astray,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote> 'We must press our
            Enemy, and no longer wait upon him for the move. See my friends, when I had mastered the
            Stone, I learned many things. A grave peril I saw coming unlooked-for upon Gondor from
            the South that will draw off great strength from the defence of Minas Tirith. If it is
            not countered swiftly, I deem that the City will be lost ere ten days be
        gone.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then lost it must be,' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'For what help is there to send
            thither, and how could it come there in time?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I have no help to send, therefore I must go myself,' </quote>said Aragorn.<quote>
            'But there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me to the coastlands
            before all is lost. That is the Paths of the Dead.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The Paths of the Dead!' </quote>said Gimli.<quote> 'It is a fell name; and little
            to the liking to the Men of Rohan, as I saw. Can the living use such a road and not
            perish? And even if you pass that way, what will so few avail to counter the strokes of
            Mordor?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'The living have never used that road since the coming of the Rohirrim,'
        </quote>said Aragorn,<quote> 'for it is closed to them. But in this dark hour the heir of
            Isildur may use it, if he dare. Listen! This is the word that the sons of Elrond bring
            to me from their father in Rivendell, wisest in lore: _Bid Aragorn remember the words of
            the seer, and the Paths of the Dead_.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And what may be the words of the seer?' </quote>said Legolas.</p>
    <p> "Thus spoke Malbeth the Seer, in the days of Arvedui, last king at Fornost,' said
        Aragorn:</p>

    <p> Over the land there lies a long shadow,</p>
    <p> westward reaching wings of darkness.</p>
    <p> The Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings</p>
    <p> doom approaches. The Dead awaken;</p>
    <p> for the hour is come for the oathbreakers;</p>
    <p> at the Stone of Erech they shall stand again</p>
    <p> and hear there a horn in the hills ringing.</p>
    <p> Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them</p>
    <p> from the prey twilight, the forgotten people?</p>
    <p> The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.</p>
    <p> From the North shall he come, need shall drive him:</p>
    <p> he shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead.</p>

    <p>
        <quote> 'Dark ways doubtless, said Gimli, but no darker than these staves are to
            me.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'If you would understand them better, then I bid you come with me,' </quote>said
            Aragorn;<quote> 'for that way I now shall take. But I do not go gladly; only need drives
            me. Therefore, only of your free will would I have you come, for you will find both toil
            and great fear, and maybe worse.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will go with you even on the Paths of the Dead, and to whatever, end they may
            lead,' </quote>said Gimli.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I also will come,' </quote>said Legolas,<quote> 'for I do not fear the
            Dead.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to fight,'
        </quote>said Gimli;<quote> 'for otherwise I see not why we should trouble them.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'That we shall know if ever we come to Erech,' </quote>said Aragorn. 'But the oath
        that they broke was to fight against Sauron, and they must fight therefore, if they are to
        fulfil it. For at Erech there stands yet a black stone that was brought, it was said, from
        N�menor by Isildur; and it was set upon a hill, and upon it the King of the Mountains swore
        allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of Gondor. But when Sauron returned and grew
        in might again, Isildur summoned the Men of the Mountains to fulfil their oath, and they
        would not: for they had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then Isildur said to their king: "Thou shalt be the last king. And if the West
            prove mightier than thy Black Master, this curse I lay upon thee and thy folk: to rest
            never until your oath is fulfilled. For this war will last through years uncounted, and
            you shall be summoned once again ere the end." And they fled before the wrath of
            Isildur, and did not dare to go forth to war on Sauron's part; and they hid themselves
            in secret places in the mountains and had no dealings with other men, but slowly
            dwindled in the barren hills. And the terror of the Sleepless Dead lies about the Hill
            of Erech and all places where that people lingered. But that way I must go, since there
            are none living to help me.'</quote>
    </p>
    <p> He stood up.<quote> 'Come!' </quote>he cried, and drew his sword, and it flashed in the
        twilit hall of the Burg.<quote> 'To the Stone of Erech! I seek the Paths of the Dead. Come
            with me who will!'</quote></p>
    <p> Legolas and Gimli made no answer, but they rose and followed Aragorn from the hall. On the
        green there waited, still and silent, the hooded Rangers. Legolas and Gimli mounted. Aragorn
        sprang upon Roheryn. Then Halbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in Helm's
        Deep; and with that they leapt away, riding down the Coomb like thunder, while all the men
        that were left on Dike or Burg stared in amaze.</p>
    <p> And while Th�oden went by slow paths in the hills, the Grey Company passed swiftly over the
        plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they came to Edoras; and there they halted only
        briefly, ere they passed up the valley, and so came to Dunharrow as darkness fell.</p>
    <p> The Lady �owyn greeted them and was glad of their coming; for no mightier men had she seen
        than the D�nedain and the fair sons of Elrond; but on Aragorn most of all her eyes rested.
        And when they sat at supper with her, they talked together, and she heard of all that had
        passed since Th�oden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her; and
        when she heard of the battle in Helm's Deep and the great slaughter of their foes, and of
        the charge of Th�oden and his knights, then her eyes shone.</p>
    <p> But at last she said:<quote> 'Lords, you are weary and shall now go to your beds with such
            ease as can be contrived in haste. But tomorrow fairer housing shall be found for
            you.'</quote></p>
    <p> But Aragorn said:<quote> 'Nay, lady, be not troubled for us! If we may lie here tonight and
            break our fast tomorrow, it will be enough. For I ride on an errand most urgent, and
            with the first light of morning we must go.'</quote></p>
    <p> She smiled on him and said:<quote> 'Then it was kindly done, lord, to ride so many miles out
            of your way to bring tidings to �owyn, and to speak with her in her exile.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Indeed no man would count such a journey wasted,' </quote>said Aragorn;<quote> 'and
            yet, lady, I could not have come hither, if it were not that the road which I must take
            leads me to Dunharrow.'</quote></p>
    <p> And she answered as one that likes not what is said: "Then, lord, you are astray; for out of
        Harrowdale no road runs east or south; and you had best return as you came.'</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nay, lady,' </quote>said he,<quote> 'I am not astray; for I walked in this land ere
            you were born to grace it. There is a road out of this valley, and that road I shall
            take. Tomorrow I shall ride by the Paths of the Dead.'</quote></p>
    <p> Then she stared at him as one that is stricken, and her face blanched, and for long she
        spoke no more, while all sat silent.<quote> 'But, Aragorn,' </quote>she said at last,<quote>
            'is it then your errand to seek death? For that is all that you will find on that road.
            They do not suffer the living to pass.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'They may suffer me to pass,' </quote>said Aragorn;<quote> 'but at the least I will
            adventure it. No other road will serve.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'But this is madness,' </quote>she said.<quote> 'For here are men of renown and
            prowess, whom you should not take into the shadows, but should lead to war, where men
            are needed. I beg you to remain and ride with my brother; for then all our hearts will
            be gladdened, and our hope be the brighter.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'It is not madness, lady,' </quote>he answered;<quote> 'for I go on a path
            appointed. But those who follow me do so of their free will; and if they wish now to
            remain and ride with the Rohirrim, they may do so. But I shall take the Paths of the
            Dead, alone, if needs be.'</quote></p>
    <p> Then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever upon Aragorn, and
        the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. At length they arose, and took their
        leave of the Lady, and thanked her for her care, and went to their rest.</p>
    <p> But as Aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with Legolas and Gimli, and his
        companions had gone in. there came the Lady �owyn after him and called to him. He turned and
        saw her as a glimmer in the night, for she was clad in white; but her eyes were on fire.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Aragorn,' </quote>she said,<quote> 'why will you go on this deadly
        road?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Because I must,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Only so can I see any hope of doing my
            part in the war against Sauron. I do not choose paths of peril, �owyn. Were I to go
            where my heart dwells, far in the North I would now be wandering in the fair valley of
            Rivendell.'</quote></p>
    <p> For a while she was silent, as if pondering what this might mean. Then suddenly she laid her
        hand on his arm.<quote> 'You are a stern lord and resolute,' </quote>she said;<quote> 'and
            thus do men win renown.' </quote>She paused.<quote> 'Lord.' </quote>she said,<quote> 'if
            you must go, then let me ride in your following. For I am weary of skulking in the
            hills, and wish to face peril and battle.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Your duty is with your people,' </quote>he answered.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Too often have I heard of duty,' </quote>she cried.<quote> 'But am I not of the
            House of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? I have waited on faltering feet long
            enough. Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not now spend my life as I
            will?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Few may do that with honour,' </quote>he answered.<quote> 'But as for you, lady:
            did you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord's return? If you had
            not been chosen, then some marshal or captain would have been set in the same place, and
            he could not ride away from his charge, were he weary of it or no.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Shall I always be chosen?' </quote>she said bitterly.<quote> 'Shall I always be
            left behind when the Riders depart, to mind the house while they win renown, and find
            food and beds when they return?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'A time may come soon,' </quote>said he,<quote> 'when none will return. Then there
            will be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember the deeds that are done
            in the last defence of your homes. Yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they
            are unpraised.'</quote></p>
    <p> And she answered:<quote> 'All your words are but to say: you are a woman, and your part is
            in the house. But when the men have died in battle and honour, you have leave to be
            burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. But I am of the House of Eorl and
            not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or
            death.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'What do you fear, lady?' </quote>he asked.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'A cage,' </quote>she said.<quote> 'To stay behind bars, until use and old age
            accept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or
            desire.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'And yet you counselled me not to adventure on the road that I had chosen, because
            it is perilous?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'So may one counsel another,' </quote>she said.<quote> 'Yet I do not bid you flee
            from peril, but to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory. I would
            not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Nor would I,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'Therefore I say to you, lady: Stay! For you
            have no errand to the South.'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Neither have those others who go with thee. They go only because they would not be
            parted from thee � because they love thee.' </quote>Then she turned and vanished into
        the night.</p>
    <p> When the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet risen above the high
        ridges in the East, Aragorn made ready to depart. His company was all mounted, and he was
        about to leap into the saddle, when the Lady �owyn came to bid them farewell. She was clad
        as a Rider and girt with a sword. In her hand she bore a cup, and she set it to her lips and
        drank a little, wishing them good speed; and then she gave the cup to Aragorn, and he drank,
        and he said:<quote> 'Farewell, Lady of Rohan! I drink to the fortunes of your House, and of
            you, and of all your people. Say to your brother: beyond the shadows we may meet
            again!'</quote></p>
    <p> Then it seemed to Gimli and Legolas who were nearby that she wept, and in one so stern and
        proud that seemed the more grievous. But she said:<quote> 'Aragorn, wilt thou
        go?'</quote></p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will,' </quote>he said.</p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'Then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as I have asked?'</quote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <quote> 'I will not, lady,' </quote>he said.<quote> 'For that I could not grant without
            leave of the king and of your brother; and they will not return until tomorrow. But I
            count now every hour, indeed every minute. Farewell!'</quote></p>
    <p> Then s</p>
